	<img src="images/inner/droplet.jpg" width="235" height="180" align="left" alt="Air2Water - Pure, Clean Drinking Water">
	
	<p>Clean drinking water is needed throughout the world and is quickly becoming the most highly valued resource of all. However, ninety-seven percent of the earth's water is contained in the world's oceans. It is undrinkable, and for the most part, unusable for culinary and commercial purposes. Only three (3) percent of the world's water is fresh. Of this three percent, two-thirds is locked in glaciers and polar ice caps. Of the remaining one percent of the earth's water, about half is located beneath the earth's surface.</p>
	
	<p>Rivers and lakes contain approximately 1/50th of one percent of the earth's water. A significant portion of this fraction has been contaminated by industrial civilization, and much of the remaining "freshwater" is severely polluted or biologically contaminated. Unfortunately, this pollution has begun to reach our underground water as well. Incessantly, on any given day, more than one-half of the earth's human population is ill, with the majority of these cases caused by waterborne contaminants.</p>
	
	<p>The World Health Organization of the United Nations estimates 3.575 million people die each year from water-related disease . Many countries throughout the world, not just third world countries, have inadequate water treatment facilities, or a complete lack of treatment facilities. It is becoming clear that new technologies are needed in every segment of the water treatment industry: agriculture, horticulture, food processing, industrial waste treatment, public water supplies, and sewage treatment. These systems must be environmentally friendly and rely on methods and processes that are not chemically based.</p>
	
	<h3 class="standard">The Need</h3>
	
	<p>At any given time, it is estimated that the earth's atmosphere contains approximately 3.4 quadrillion (or 3400 trillion) US gallons of water in vapor form*. This may sound like a lot, but compared to the earth's total watershed it represents approximately 0.001%. The key is that the water in the atmosphere regenerates as a form of recycling of the earth's oceans and fresh ground water. Therefore, so long as there is water on earth, there will be water in the atmosphere. We don't need to be concerned with the quality or type of ground water sources that are evaporating because only H2O molecules end up as vapor. The earth's oceans are a perfect example of this. The vapor that is created when seawater evaporates is not salt vapor but rather water vapor with trace elements of salt. This is only prevalent in coastal areas. For that very reason, <b>Air2Water</b> generators are manufactured using galvanized parts and salt resistant coatings. For the rest of the world the vapor is mostly clean and our air filtration media remove particulate matter. The condensation process takes care of the rest, ensuring that the water that goes through our filter systems starts out as natural condensed H2O.</p>
	
	<img src="images/inner/ultraviolet.jpg" width="239" height="163" align="right" vspace="2" hspace="10" alt="Air2Water - Basic Concept">
	
	
	<h3 class="standard">Basic Concept</h3>
	<P><b>Air2Water</b> products are best described as <b><i>Atmospheric Water Generators</i></b> (AWG). <b>Air2Water</b> AWG units use technology (developed and patented by Worldwide Water, Inc.) that extracts clean drinking water from the air. The unit first pulls air through an electrostatic filter removing 93% of all air borne particles. As it collects water drops into a collection tray and immediately passes into Ultraviolet (UV) light, where the water stays in contact with UV rays killing germs and bacteria in the water. The water is then pumped through a sediment screen into a water pump and through a series of solid carbon block, UF or no waste R/O water filters. The water is then re-circulated through UV or treated by ozonation. It is then circulated back into the dispensing tanks. Finally, the water is chilled or heated and dispensed to the consumer.</P>
	
	
	<h3 class="standard">Product Claims</h3>
	<p><b>Air2Water</b> home/office AWG units produce up to 28 Liters (7.4 Gallons) of clean drinking water every 24 hours at peak efficiency in locations with the highest temperatures and relative humidity. Our new Dolphin 2C countertop model produces 24 Liters (6.3 Gallons) per day and our Dolphins 1, 2 and 4 upright units produce between 24 and 26 Liters (6.3 Gallons and 6.9 Gallons) per day at 75F and 65% RH. The advanced electronic sensors ensure that the unit halts operation once the tank is full.</p>
	
	<p><img src="images/inner/productclaims.jpg" alt="Air2Water - Product Claims" width="250" height="180" border="0" align="left">These generators also cleanse the air as they produce water by using an electrostatic air filter, which removes ninety three percent (93%) of all airborne particles.</p>
	
	
	<p>Clean drinking water can be produced in your own home and/or office. No more trips to the store or carrying heavy jugs of water. By having your own water generator, you no longer need to rely on access to bottled drinking water as your best water source. No more big, bulky 5-gallon bottles to store. No more heavy water bottles to change.</p>
	<p>Our <b>Triton</b> series of industrial atmospheric water generators produce up to 3350 gallons/12,663L per day at 85F/70%RH while supplying dry cool air to indoor environments. Cost of water production is usually a factor of 1.3 times the cost of a kWh of electricity. </p>
	<p>All <b>Air2Water</b> AWG units are energy and cost efficient. Studies have been carried out to determine the cost of producing water with our home/office units. Results show that these models produce clean drinking water at $0.04 to $0.13 per Liter depending upon the model, price of electricity and location.</p>
	<p>Chemicals that are usually present in normal tap and filtered tap water, such as chlorine and fluoride, are not present in the water produced by <b>Air2Water</b> AWG units. These chemicals are usually added to the water by city and county water departments. Research has shown that too much chlorine contributes to certain types of cancer. Studies on fluoride in drinking water are inconclusive as to the amount of good or harm caused.</p>
	
	<h3 class="standard">Manufacturing Facilities</h3>
	<p><b>Air2Water</b> manufactures our AWG units in state-of-the-art facilities renowned for the quality manufacturing of water purification equipment and appliances. <b>Air2Water</b> <b><i>Atmospheric Water Generators</i></b> are manufactured to the highest standards.</p>
	
	<h3 class="standard">State-Of-The-Art Infrastructure for Optimum Results</h3>
	<p><b>Air2Water</b> manufacturing facilities possess a wide range of specialized facilities designed to produce high-quality atmospheric water generators that comply with <b>Air2Water</b>/Worldwide Water's patented processes. Our manufacturing facilities are located in Zhejiang, Nanjing and Shenzhen, China, while our Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for <b>Triton</b> industrial atmospheric water generators is located in Texas, USA.</P>
	
	
	<h3 class="standard">Computer Assisted Design (CAD)</h3>
	<p>To ensure high levels of precision detailing in our design plans and piping circuits, <b>Air2Water</b> utilizes the latest dedicated engineering software and computer assisted design programs.</P>
