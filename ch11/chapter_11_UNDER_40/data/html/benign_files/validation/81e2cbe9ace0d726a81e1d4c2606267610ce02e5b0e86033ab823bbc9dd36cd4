          <p>After about 6 and 1/2 years of running this blog and community I'd like to officially announce that we are wrapping up The Daily Block (as we know it).</p>
          <p>During this time, 9,720 posts were made, 10,400 tumblr followers were gained and over 3000 players logged into our Minecraft server.</p>
          <p>I'd like to take the time to acknowledge all the amazing, awesome, outstanding and just plain fantastic people who made this community what it was for so many years - I have had so many good times with you all and met so many amazing people during this time.</p>
          <p>The memories, experiences and good times that we shared will always remain with me regardless of if we never get in touch again - and I hope they do for you too.</p>
          <p>While the blog hasn't seen active posts for a long time, the server was still seeing reasonably good use up to about 6 months ago by a core group of players. However we've decided that since we've all really stopped playing Minecraft now, there is no point to leaving the server online when we aren't even going to be using it. To be fair, we've played Minecraft for 6 years straight now - so it's probably time we moved on to something new!</p>
          <p>What next? We don't know. But I'll be retaining this domain name for the foreseeable future. You can also still visit the old blog <a href="http://blog.thedailyblock.co.nz">here</a>.</p>
          <p>If you'd like to stay in touch or see what happens in any future adventures, you will always be able to find me at <a href="http://southpaw.co.nz">southpaw.co.nz</a> or join our <a href="https://discord.gg/ufk49hc">Discord server</a>.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for this amazing opportunity and experience. We wish you the best and hope that we may cross paths again in the future.</p>
          <p>Best wishes from the team,</p>
          <p>Alex (South_Paw) <br>Hannah (Celticlove1995) <br>Conor (Condaminium) <br>Scott (Typical_Cyanide) <br>Rey (DWN015) <br>Resi (resir014) <br>Tommy (Kaj Taotsu)</p>
