					<h3>Welcome to HB2018!</h3>
					<p>The 61st ICFA Advanced Beam Dynamics Workshop on
						High-Intensity and High- Brightness Hadron Beams (HB2018) will be
						held in Daejeon, Korea from June 18 to June 22, 2018. The venue
						will be the brand new campus of the Institute for Basic Science
						(IBS) which was established in November 2011 to promote the basic
						science research. The IBS is also a home to the heavy ion
						accelerator facility, the RAON which is under construction.</p>
					<p>The HB workshop is the main international event for the
						high-intensity hadron beam community. Attendees will be presented
						with the latest development results and gain the latest insights.
						About 200 delegates and industry exhibits are expected to be in
						attendance. The HB consists of plenary sessions, two parallel
						sessions and poster sessions covering Beam Dynamics in Rings
						(WG-A), Beam Dynamics in Linacs (WG-B), Accelerator Systems
						(WG-C), Commissioning and Operations (WG-D) and Beam Instruments
						and Interactions (WG-E).</p>
					<p>Daejeon is known as the science city of Korea and is a home
						to majority of the national laboratories and several prestigious
						universities.</p>
					<p>Welcome to HB2018 and enjoy your stay in Daejeon.</p>
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					Dong-O Jeon
					<p>HB2018 Chair</p>
