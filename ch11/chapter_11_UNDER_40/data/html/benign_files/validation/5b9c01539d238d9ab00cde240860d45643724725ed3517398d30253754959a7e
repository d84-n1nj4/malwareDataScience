<p><span lang="en">This course aims to provide extensive and thoughtful training, to a wide range of students, through a carefully constructed and inspiring course of home study, complemented by stimulating practical tuition workshops.  We teach not only the physical uses of essential oils, but also the holistic, subtle and ethical aspects of aromatherapy.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">We aim to be &#8216;holistic&#8217; in a large sense &#8211; promoting an awareness of the wider implications of our activities and the use of materials.  In a world and a culture that has been over-exploited our self-aware, ethically conscious aromatherapy students are enabled to facilitate the letting-go of old habits that no longer promote health and bring in a fresh out-look, as individuals, in their relationships with others and on a planetary level. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">After successful completion of the Welsh School of Aromatherapy course you will be able to practice professionally as a Holistic Aromatherapist and students are invited to take the International Federation of Aromatherapists (IFA) examination to register as an accredited IFA aromatherapist. </span></p>
