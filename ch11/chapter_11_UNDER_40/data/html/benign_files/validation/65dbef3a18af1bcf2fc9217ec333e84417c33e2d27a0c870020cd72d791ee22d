<div class="text">An invention is a new form, composition of

based on pre-existing forms, compositions, processes or <a href=
"https://idea.askdefine.com">idea</a>s. Other inventions are radical

experience.</div>
<div class="text">Invention that gets out into the world is

<h2>The process of invention</h2>Invention is a highly <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=creative%20process">creative
process</a>.</div>
<div class="text">“Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has
seen and thinking what nobody has thought.” <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Albert%20Szent-Gyorgyi">Albert
Szent-Gyorgyi</a>, <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>
1937</div>
<div class="text">An open curious mind enables one to see beyond
what is known. Inventors <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=think%20outside%20of%20the%20box">
think outside of the box</a>. "Hell, there are no rules here —
we're trying to accomplish something." <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Thomas%20A.%20Edison">Thomas A.
Edison</a> Seeing a new possibility, a new connection or
relationship can spark invention.</div>
<div class="text">Inventive thinking frequently involves combining
elements from different realms that would not normally be put
together. Inventors skip over the boundaries between distinctly
separate territories or fields. Ways of thinking, materials,
processes or tools from one realm are used as nobody had ever
imagined in a different realm. This is how <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Cubism">Cubism</a>, one of the
most revolutionary innovations in art was invented. Taking ideas
from primitive culture, <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo
Picasso</a> and <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Georges%20Braque">Georges
Braque</a> reinvented art in the civilized world.</div>
<div class="text"><a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Play%20(activity)">Play</a> can
lead to invention. “All sorts of things can happen when you’re open
to new ideas and playing around with things.” Kevlar inventor,
<a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Stephanie%20Kwolek">Stephanie
Kwolek</a>. Childhood curiosity, experimentation and imagination
can develop into a play instinct that is an inner need according to
<a href="https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Carl%20Jung">Carl
Jung</a>. Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest
them, to explore, and this internal drive brings about novel
creations.</div>
<div class="text">Einstein also said, “To raise new questions, new
possibilities, to regard old questions from a new angle, requires
creative imagination and marks real advance.” and “Imagination is
more important than knowledge.” Inventors often envision a new
idea, seeing it in their mind. New ideas often come when the
conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem, when you are
focusing on something else, relaxing, at rest or sleeping. A novel
idea may come in a flash - <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Eureka">Eureka</a>! For example,
after years of working to figure out the general theory of
relativity, the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream “like
a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe
outlined itself in one clear vision.”</div>
<div class="text">Inventing also takes insight. It may begin with
questions, doubt or a hunch. It may begin by recognizing that
something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it opens a
new avenue for exploration. For example, the odd metallic color of
plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much
catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties,
inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting
plastic - invention that won the Nobel Prize in 2000 (see <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=conductive%20polymer">conductive
polymer</a>, and <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=organic%20light-emitting%20diode">
organic light-emitting diode</a> or <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=PLED">PLED</a>).</div>
<div class="text">“Inspiration exists, but it has to find us
working.” Picasso No matter how complete the initial <a href=
"https://idea.askdefine.com">idea</a> is as a spark, a hunch or a
vision, inventions typically have to be worked. Inventing is often
an exploratory process, full of risk, with failures as well as
successes, and it's outcome is not known or not fully known. “If we
knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research,
would it?” Einstein Inventors believe in their ideas and they do
not give up in the face of one or many failures. Their
perseverance, confidence and passion is famous. “If I find 10,000
ways something won't work, I haven't failed. I am not discouraged,
because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.”
Thomas A. Edison, who also declared, “I never did a day's work in
my life, it was all fun.”</div>
<div class="text">Inventors want to satisfy a need, they try to
solve a problem or make something better, asking what if or,
wouldn't it be great if. "Discontent is the first necessity of
progress." Edison Inventors may for example, try to improve
something by making it more effective, healthier, faster, more
efficient, easier to use, serve more purposes, longer lasting,
cheaper, more <a href=
"https://ecological.askdefine.com">ecological</a>ly friendly, or
<a href="https://aesthetic.askdefine.com">aesthetic</a>ally
different, e.g., lighter weight, more <a href=
"https://ergonomic.askdefine.com">ergonomic</a>, structurally
different, with new light or color properties, etc. Or an entirely
new invention may be created like the <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Internet">Internet</a>, <a href=
"https://email.askdefine.com">email</a>, the <a href=
"https://telephone.askdefine.com">telephone</a> or <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=electric%20light">electric
light</a>. "Necessity, who is the mother of invention." Plato Yet
invention is also the mother of necessity. Nobody needed a
phonograph before Edision invented it, the need for it developed
afterwards. Likewise, few ever imagined the telephone or the
airplane prior to their invention, but many people cannot live
without these inventions now.</div>
<div class="text">The idea for an invention may be developed on
paper or on a computer, by writing or drawing, by <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=trial%20and%20error">trial and
error</a>, by making models, by <a href=
"https://experiment.askdefine.com">experiment</a>ing, by testing
and/or by making the invention in its whole form. As the dialogue
between Picasso and Braque brought about Cubism, collaboration has
spawned many inventions. Brainstorming can spark new ideas.
Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by designers,
architects and scientists. Co-inventors are frequently named on
patents. Now it is easier than ever for people in different
locations to collaborate. Many inventors keep <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=inventor's%20notebook">records</a>
of their working process - <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=inventor's%20notebook">notebooks</a>,
photos, etc., including <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo
da Vinci</a>, <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas
Jefferson</a> and Albert Einstein. In the process of developing an
invention, the initial idea may change. The invention may become
simpler, more practical, it may expand, or it may even morph into
something totally different. Working on one invention can lead to
others too. There is only one country in the world that will grant
patent rights for an invention that continues part of an invention
in a previously filed patent, the United States.</div>
<div class="text">The creation of an invention and its use can be
effected by practical considerations. Some inventions are not
created in the order that enables them to be most useful. For
example, the <a href="https://parachute.askdefine.com">parachute</a>
was invented before powered <a href=
"https://flight.askdefine.com">flight</a>. There are inventions that
are too expensive to produce and inventions that require scientific
advancements that have not yet occurred. These barriers can erode
or disappear as the economic situation changes or as science
develops. But history shows that turning an invention that is only
an idea into reality can take any amount of time, even centuries as
demonstrated by inventions originally conceived by <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo
da Vinci</a> which are now in physical form and commonplace in our
lives. Interestingly, some invention that exists as only an idea
and has never been made in reality can obtain patent
protection.</div>
<div class="text">An invention can serve many purposes, these
purposes might differ significantly and they may change over time.
An invention or a further developed version of it may serve
purposes never envisioned by its original inventor(s) or even by
others living at the time of it's original invention. As an
example, consider all the kinds of <a href=
"https://plastic.askdefine.com">plastic</a> developed, their
innumerable uses, and the tremendous growth this material invention
is still undergoing today.</div>
<div class="text">
<h2>Artistic invention</h2></div>
<div class="text">Invention has a long and important history in
<a href="https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=the%20arts">the
arts</a>. Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the
<a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=creative%20process">creative
process</a>. While some inventions in the arts are <a href=
"https://patentable.askdefine.com">patentable</a>, others are not
because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments
have established for granting them, (see <a href=
"https://patent.askdefine.com">patent</a>).</div>
<div class="text">
<h3>In art, design and architecture</h3></div>
<div class="text">“A man paints with his brains and not with his
hands.” Michelangelo</div>
<div class="text"><a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Art">Art</a> is continuously
reinvented. Many artists, designers, and architects think like
inventors. As they create, they may for example: explore beyond
that which is known or obvious, push against barriers, change or
discard conventions, and/or break into new territory. Some artists
are inventors and among their inventions are important
contributions to visual art as well as other fields.</div>
<div class="text">Some visual artists like <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Picasso">Picasso</a> become
inventors in the process of creating art. Inventions by other
artists are separate from their art, such as the scientific
inventions of <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo
da Vinci</a>. Some inventions in visual art employ prior
developments in science or technology. For example, Picasso and
<a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Julio%20Gonzalez%20(sculptor)">Julio
Gonzalez</a> used welding to invent a new kind of sculpture, the
form of which could be more open to light and air, and more
recently, computer software has enabled an explosion of invention
in visual art, including the invention of <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=computer%20art">computer
art</a>, and invention in <a href=
"https://photography.askdefine.com">photography</a>, <a href=
"https://film.askdefine.com">film</a>, <a href=
"https://architecture.askdefine.com">architecture</a> and <a href=
"https://design.askdefine.com">design</a>. Like the invention of
welded sculpture, other inventions in art are new art forms, for
example, the <a href="https://collage.askdefine.com">collage</a> and
the construction invented by Picasso, the <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Readymade">Readymade</a>
invented by <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Marcel%20Duchamp">Marcel
Duchamp</a>, the <a href="https://mobile.askdefine.com">mobile</a>
invented by <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Alexander%20Calder">Alexander
Calder</a>, the combine invented by <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Robert%20Rauschenberg">Robert
Rauschenberg</a>, and the shaped painting invented by <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Frank%20Stella">Frank
Stella</a>. A number of art movements were inventions often created
collaboratively, such as <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Cubism">Cubism</a> invented by
Picasso and <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Braque">Braque</a>. Substantial
inventions in art, design and architecture were made possible by
inventions and improvements in the tools of the trade. The
invention of <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Impressionist">Impressionist</a>
painting, for example, was possible because the prior invention of
collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes facilitated spontaneous
painting outdoors. Inventions originally created in the form of
artwork can also develop other uses, as Alexander Calder's mobile
is commonly used over babies' cribs today. Funds generated from
patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support
the realization of the invention or other creative work. <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Frederic%20Auguste%20Bartholdi">Frederic
Auguste Bartholdi</a>'s 1879 patent on the <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of

because it covered small replicas..</div>

have been patented. Others might have fulfilled the requirements of
a patent, like <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Cubism">the Cubist image</a>.
There are also inventions in visual art that do not fit into the
requirements of a patent. Examples are inventions that cannot be
differentiated from that which has already existed clearly enough
for approval by government patent offices, such as Duchamp's
Readymade and other conceptual works. Invention whose inventor or
inventors are not known cannot be patented, such as the invention
of <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=abstract%20art">abstract art</a>
or <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=abstract%20painting">abstract

<a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Installation%20art">Installation
art</a> and Light Art. Also, when it cannot or has not been
determined whether something was a first in human history or not,
there may not be a patentable invention even though it may be
considered an invention in the realm of art. For example, Picasso
is credited with inventing collage though this probably was done
earlier in a culture outside of the western world.</div>
<div class="text">Inventions in the visual arts that may be
patentable might be new materials or mediums, they might be new
kinds of images, they might be new processes, they might be novel
designs, or they may be a combination of these. Inventions by

<h2>Getting inventions out into the world</h2></div>
<div class="text">Inventions get out into the world in different
ways. Some of them are sold, licensed or given away as products or
services. Simply exhibiting visual art, playing music or having a
performance gets many artistic inventions out into the world.
Believing in the success of an invention can involve risk, so it
can be difficult to obtain support and funding. Grants, inventor
associations, clubs and <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=business%20incubator">business
incubator</a>s can provide the mentoring, skills and resources some
inventors need. Success at getting an invention out into the world

"https://patent.askdefine.com">patent</a> system captures those
<a href="https://externality.askdefine.com">positive
externalities</a> for the inventor or other patent owner, so that
the economy as a whole will invest a more-closely-optimum amount of
resources in the process of invention.</div>

<h2>Invention and innovation</h2></div>
<div class="text"><a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Innovation">Innovation</a> is
"something new or different introduced." www.Dictionary.com</div>
<div class="text">In the social sciences, an innovation is anything
new to a culture, whether it has been adopted or not. The theory
for adoption (or non-adoption) of an innovation called <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=diffusion%20of%20innovations">diffusion
of innovations</a> considers the likelihood that an innovation will
ever be adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or
spur its adoption. This theory was first put forth by <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Everett%20Rogers">Everett
Rogers</a>. <a href=
"https://www.askdefine.com/search?q=Gabriel%20Tarde">Gabriel
Tarde</a> also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his Laws
of Imitation.</div>

<ul>
<li>“When most people think that everything is working normally, an
inventor will home in on the absurdity, the utter foolishness of
the way everyone seems to accept the world as it is. Others won’t
even see what’s wrong-until the inventor stumbles across it. By
isolating a problem in a new way, by redefining it, by focusing it
does to something more specific than meets the average eye, the
inventor constructs a new possibility where none was though to have
existed.” Evan I. Schwartz</ul></div>
