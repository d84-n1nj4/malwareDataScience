<p>A common metabolic problem in newborns is a condition known as neonatal hypoglycemia.  The condition is present whenever there is a blood sugar level of less than 30 mg/dl for the first day following birth, less than 45 mg/dL for the second day following birth, and is found in 1.3 to 3 percent of all newborns.  Neonatal hypoglycemia is more common in babies who are of a larger size, who may have had an infection, who had some type of fetal distress, or those who had a diabetic mother.  In some cases the condition may have no symptoms, but there may be heart, respiratory, or central nervous system issues.  Many cases show signs of vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and an altered mental state. </p>

<h3>Brain Damage</h3><BR>

<p>Serious developmental issues can result if the baby has been exposed to repeated hypoglycemia, which can have a negative impact on the brain.  The condition can worse, and cause brain damage if there has been a lack of oxygen, lack of blood, hypoxia, or ischemia. </p>
<h3>Risk Factors</h3><BR>

<p>Newborns weighing more than four kilograms or less than two kilograms are at an increased risk for hypoglycemia.  Nearly one in one thousand pregnant women is diabetic and two percent of all pregnant women acquire gestational diabetes.  This also increases the chances of the baby developing the condition of hypoglycemia. </p>
 <h3>Symptoms</h3><BR>
 
<p>Common symptoms associated with neonatal hypoglycemia include: seizures, a low Apgar score, jitteriness, lethargy, low feeding, rapid breathing, and a fluctuation in body temperature.  If the mother took hypoglycemic medication, beta blockers, terbutaline, has an enlarged liver, or if the baby was in fetal distress, neonatal hypoglycemia needs to be looked into. </p>
<h3>Monitoring</h3><BR>

<p>Anytime a baby is suspected of having hypoglycemia, regular monitoring should take place on the hour, every hour to track blood glucose levels.  This should continue until the levels stabilize.  If it is determined that blood sugar is too low, an IV solution containing dextrose can be given.  In severe cases, anti seizure medications may be needed to control seizures that may develop.  Sodium bicarbonate can also be given if acidosis is present.  Acidosis is a condition that causes blood pH to be below 7.1.  The main idea with any variation of treatment is to bring blood glucose level to greater than 45 mg/dL full time.  With time, the baby will start to drink sugar water by him or herself, and dextrose can be added to the bottle until all levels seem to be normal. </p>
<h3>Treatment</h3><BR>

<p>In order to ensure there are no serious complications or there is no permanent brain or neurological damage, hypoglycemia needs to be treated quickly.  It is recommended that newborns be fed early so that blood sugar levels can rise naturally.  If the baby is too lethargic to eat on his or her own, a nasogastric tube can be inserted into the throat to verify the babyâ€™s ability to suck.  Cortisol is not recommended in the course of treatment because it has been shown to be slow to react and actually mask the true cause of the hypoglycemia. </p>
