  <h2>Who is Agpoint:</h2>
  <p>Located in southern Lancaster County, Agpoint was born from  a desire for our parent company-Paul Risk Associates- to start an Agricultural division after completing an equestrian project in Maryland. </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulrisk.com" title="See the Paul Risk Site"><img src="images/prclogo.jpg" alt="Paul Risk logo" width="320" height="160" class="imgcentered"></a></p>
  <p>We continue to grow, putting the experience and knowledge to work. Agpoint is able to design and submit engineer stamped drawings when required for the permitting process. This includes filling out paperwork required by the township/county to meet their standards to build your project. We have completed several projects in the past few years and we are licensed in several states including Virginia.  </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.nfba.org" title="Go to the official NFBA site"><img src="images/nfbalogo.jpg" alt="NFBA logo" width="300" height="188" class="imgcentered"></a></p>
  <h2>NFBA Certification</h2>
  <p>Agpoint Construction Services has earned the status of accredited National Frame Builders Association. This status requires exceptional commitment to quality workmanship, state and local building codes, safety standards and ethical business practices. In order to maintain accredited status Agpoint Construction Services is required to earn continuing education units. We went to Indianapolis this year and won the NFBA 2015 Building of the Year Experts Division Institutional Buildings. The announcement should be in the April issue.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This website has photos  of some of the projects that we have built in recent years.</p>
