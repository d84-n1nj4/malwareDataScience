Tania said she would have that letter for me by the following Monday.<br /><br />Later, I did a little bit of research (thanks to some advice I received from online friends) and I found out that according to Tennessee state statutes, utilities ar not allowed to pursue any debts older than 6 years (T. CA 28.3.109).&nbsp; I had dialysis on Monday so I showed up at their office on Tuesday and went in to see Tania.&nbsp; I explained to her about the state statute of limitations and she still insisted on pursueing this debt - a debt that was obviously a mistake, that they could not produce a bill for, and which was illegal for them to pursue anyway!&nbsp; Tania made me the same $50 a month offer with an additional discount of 50% off of the installation fee because I was on public assistance. I am still wondering why this was never offerred before and if any other Ben Lomand members on public assistance have ever been offerred this deal.<br /><br />At this point I asked to speak to Mike Burdwell, District Manager.&nbsp; Basically, Mike let me know that the fact that I needed the phone to be informed of a transplant match was "irrelevant".&nbsp; He also let me know that they would consult their attorney about the statute of limitations and then let me know.&nbsp; In the end, I finally recieved an email from Tania letting me know that they have consulted with their attorney and that the statute of limitations has indeed run out and they would grant me a phone with a $100 returnable deposit after one year due to my "adverse payment record".&nbsp; I wrote her back an email turning her offer down. (see below)<br /><br />Had Tania offerred me this deal when I first walked in I most likely would have taken it.&nbsp; But after all the crap&nbsp; they put me through trying to shake me down for whatever amount they could get out of me I decided that if they tried to jerk me around there had to be other members that they are also giving the shaft.&nbsp; These phone people are either dishonest or incompetent or both.&nbsp; Because they either knew that they could not collect on this account and tried to get money out of me anyway or else they were ignorant of a law it is their job to know about.&nbsp; And after dealing with Mike Burdwell - who is the rudest customer service person I have ever encountered - I decided to fight back to the fullest extent I could.<br /><br />I have filed complaints with the FCC, The Tennessee Regulatory Agency and with my two state representatives.&nbsp; I also have an appointment with the Tennessee Legal Aid Society on August 4th.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also submitted letters to the Editors of The Grundy County Herald and the Chattanooga Free Press. &nbsp;I also contacted my local state representatives. My aim is to inform as many people as possible of their rights when it comes to Ben Lomand and bullies like them. (later note 02/14/10 - I had&nbsp;forgotten&nbsp;to also file a complaint&nbsp;with&nbsp;the Americans with Disabilities Act).<br /><br />Below I have included a few items such as the email conversation I had with Ben Lomand, the wording of Title 28.3.109 of the Tennessee State Statute.&nbsp; This site is under construction, so please feel free to email me at mdginzo@gmail.com with any comments or questions and I will be sure to put you on my list to let you know of any updates to this site.<br /><br /><br />Your friend and advocate,<br />Mark A. Ginzo, Jr.<br /><br /></span><br /> Mr Ginzo,<br /> <br /> After reviewing your account with management and our attorney, we have<br /> determined that your balance owed to Ben Lomand Telephone has aged and will<br /> be treated as a separate issue.<br /> <br /> We will consider you as a new customer applying for phone service. &nbsp;As with<br /> all new customers, we look at past payment history to determine if a deposit<br /> should be collected at time of application.<br /> <br /> After reviewing your account, we have determined that you will pay normal<br /> installation charges, membership fee, and $ 100.00 deposit. &nbsp;This is a<br /> standard deposit based on previous customer's payment history. &nbsp;This deposit<br /> is refundable in 18 months if payments on your account have been received on<br /> time with no disconnects due to non-payment.<br /> <br /> There will be no restrictions placed on your phone for prior history with<br /> Ben Lomand.<br /> <br /> As per our conversation before, we will be glad to work with you in order<br /> that you may have phone service installed.<br /> <br /> If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 592-2121.<br /> <br /> Thank-you<br /> <span>Tania</span> Curtis<br /> Branch Customer Service Supervisor<br /> <br /> <br /> -----Original Message-----<br /> From: Ben Lomand Internet [mailto:<a href="mailto:inet_dept@blomand.net">inet_dept@blomand.net</a>]<br /> Sent: Thursday, July 16, 2009 9:02 AM<br /> To: '<span>Tania</span> Curtis'; <a href="mailto:kayeh@blomand.net">kayeh@blomand.net</a><br /> Subject: FW: Contact US<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> -----Original Message-----<br /> From: <a href="mailto:mdginzo@gmail.com">mdginzo@gmail.com</a> [mailto:<a href="mailto:mdginzo@gmail.com">mdginzo@gmail.com</a>]<br /> Sent: Saturday, July 11, 2009 1:44 PM<br /> To: <a href="mailto:inet_dept@benlomand.net">inet_dept@benlomand.net</a><br /> Subject: Contact US<br /> <br /> Message Type: Complaint<br /> Subject: Services<br /> Comments: I am a disabled person who needs a residential phone becaue I am<br /> on a transplant list. But Ben Lomand has refused me a home phone over a<br /> supposed $1400 debt from 8/97 to 1/97 that I do not owe They will not give<br /> me a phone unless I begin paying on this amount. However, they cannot<br /> produce a bill for me to either pay from or even contest. I have notified<br /> the TRA and the FCC of this situation and will be contacting Legal Aid<br /> services as well. At the moment I am hoping to reach someone at Ben Lomand<br /> that can make a reasonable decision on on this matter. I have been dealing<br /> with <span>Tania</span> Curtis on this case.

You created an impossible situation for me when you could not produce a bill for me to either pay or&nbsp; contest, yet you insisted I owed you a debt even though you had no proof of such debt. Anyone with any business sense understands that this alone is a faudulent attempt to collect money.&nbsp; You knew you had a monopoly on land lines in my area and also knew of my medical need so you thought you would try to extort money from me.&nbsp; In addition, you attempted to get me to acknowledge this debt by witholding phone service pending a $50 a month payment on said debt - an insult to my intelligence.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is a shame that no one at your office was able to make a rational decision in this case and instead wasted my time and the time and money of your members with lawyers and the complaints I had to file. The end result being that you did&nbsp; not get any money for this error and&nbsp; caused your members to incur&nbsp; additional costs in dealing with this issue and my subsequent&nbsp; complaints to the authorities.<br /><br />Tania, I have spent most of my life in sales and in customer service.&nbsp; The level of incompetence and disservice I have experienced with&nbsp;<span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; ">Ben</span>&nbsp;<span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; ">Lomand</span>&nbsp; this summer is rare.&nbsp; Since that time I have discussed your company with several of your members and have gotten the impression that dissatisfaction with your company and the people that run it is all too frequent.&nbsp; I will continue to make sure that your members know of their rights and that you have the opportunity to abuse as few of them as possible.<br /><br />Mark A.
