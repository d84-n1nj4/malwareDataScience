<h2 id="welcome-to-the-java-pathfinder-workshop">Welcome to the Java Pathfinder Workshop</h2>
<p>This year, the workshop is co-located with <a href="http://ase2017.org">ASE</a> in Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA on November 3, 2017. The goal of the workshop is to highlight research and tools for Java/Android program verification and analysis. Although there is a particular emphasis on the JPF tool, and on projects that use JPF to support basic research, tool development, or verification case studies, the workshop also welcomes contributions related to general program analysis of Java/Android programs. The hope is to use the workshop to grow the community of researchers investigating Java, Android, and JPF in an effort to foster collaboration and define future needs for program analysis of Java/Android.</p>
<h2 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h2>
<p>We solicit two types of submissions to be uploaded on <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jpf2017">EasyChair/JPF2017</a>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Regular papers: At most 5-page long papers in the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM SIG Proceedings</a> format will be reviewed by the organizing committee. Accepted regular papers will be presented at the workshop and published in the <a href="https://www.sigsoft.org/SEN">ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes</a> and the ACM Digital Library, as in previous years.</p></li>
<li><p>Extended abstracts: At most 2-page long abstracts will be selected by the organizing committee. Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop but NOT published.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Regular papers should describe research and applications related to JPF and its extensions. If the underlying research idea has been published in another venue, the paper needs to clarify the novel aspects that are being presented in the paper. Extended abstracts can describe recent work or work in progress. We also welcome comparative analysis papers that evaluate algorithms in JPF or its extensions with other relevant tools. The goal of the workshop is to encourage the flow of ideas relevant to JPF and Java/Android program analysis in general. The topics of interest include, but are not limited, to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>JPF extensions or tools</li>
<li>JPF case studies</li>
<li>Java program analysis or verification</li>
<li>Android program analysis or verification</li>
<li>General software verification techniques or tools</li>
</ul>
