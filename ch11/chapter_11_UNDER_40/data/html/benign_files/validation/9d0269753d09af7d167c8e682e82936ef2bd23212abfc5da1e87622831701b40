                    <h1>Functional Fitness Coach Soccer</h1>
                    Act2Prevent starts in 2013 with a brand new training course which, unlike our daily courses, will take several days.<br />
                    With 'Functional Fitness Coach Soccer' Act2Prevent accepts the challenge to ensure that the participants develop themselves into 'specialists' in training and coaching soccer players in the physical portion, keeping the holistic aspect of 'football' in mind.<br />
                    We aim for a very high quality level, ask a large engagement, interaction and teamwork of the participants with a unique learning environment as target.<br />
                    The course Functional 'FCS' (Fitness Coach Soccer) is split into 'FCS-Recrea' and 'FCS- PRO' so that you, as a soccer coach or trainer, can decide for yourself how deep you want to go into the topic.<br />
                    If you are very ambitious and you would like to change the current deficits in training football players into a positive outcome, please  <a href="mailto:info@act2prevent.com">contact us</a>.<br />

                    <h1>'Functional Fitness Coach Soccer - recrea'</h1>
                    Maybe you participated into an earlier education in the physical preparation of the soccer player but the content was not clear to you or ...you had the idea that the link with soccer was missing or ...it was not practical enough ... or just ... very difficult to apply?<br />
                    Or do you have notions of all the physical components that a soccer player needs to train but you miss the details or the complete picture?<br />
                    On day 1 we apply our content to the training and coaching of 'recreational soccer players' and we focus on the main insights and techniques that you can apply with limited budgets or facilities.  It is our goal to provide accessible information which is applicable and, above all, very understandable, not only for the coach but also for the football player.<br />
                    The 'Functional Fitness Coach Soccer - Recrea' understands at the end of the day the needs of the recreational soccer player and is capable to share, in a simple way, the most up-to-date techniques from the fitness world with the players.<br />
                    The 'Functional FCS-Recrea'  commits him/herself to provide his/her players and club with exercises which initially bring logic to the body and which are also linked to the sport specific needs of recreational football.  The 'Functional FCS - Recrea' is able to assess the current exercises and follow-up methods in football and has the necessary knowledge and insights to make a selection of what is effectively 'functional ... for football'!<br />
                    The 'FCS-Recrea' can participate in a number of 'open' training days of the 'FCS-PRO - training'.<br />

                    Act2Prevent commits to ensure that the participants develop themselves  into 'professional fitness specialists' in guiding football players, with full attention to the holistic aspect of 'playing football'.  Goal is that participants have the qualities to guide and train football players at the highest level in a professional and sport specific way.<br />
                    We will work towards a very high quality course and ask a large commitment, self study, interaction and teamwork of the participants with a unique learning environment as target. In addition, there is still a lot of room in the development of 'functional training programs for football', especially in topics like 'injury prevention', 'functional screening for soccer',... You can't benefit from the best player in the world ... if he is injured.<br />
                    The 'Functional FCS- PROfessional' trained by Act2Prevent is not authorised for medical acts but can be very supportive and can bring innovative added value in the health and the 'Sports Specific Performance' of the soccer player.<br />
                    The education 'Functional FCS - PRO' challenges the participants in thinking within the concept of 'soccer-oriented fitness' and also to be aware of the latest developments. Act2Prevent ensures professional incentives, qualitative contacts from the various disciplines ... and the necessary challenges and learning environment, so that you can develop into a Functional FCS-PRO!<br />
                    Your progression does not stop after our training and we ask a professional attitude and the intention to become a better coach each day. For that reason, the group will be kept informed of updates, events, brainstorm sessions, ed.

                    <h1>2014-2015: 'The 1080 Movement Assessment Specialist course' - Belgium</h1>
                    Learn how to functionally test your football players the way professional teams such as Everton FC do. 1080 MAP (Movement Assessment Profile) is a systematic testing system of functional movement patterns that creates unique profiles that directly reflects the player's physical performance. The profiles will identify physical limitations/hidden potential and determine what is needed for the player to get quick functional results, effectively reach optimal performance and prevent injuries. With the 1080 MAP profile you will be able to design highly effective training programs. Just a few exercises will be needed, because of the effective and meaningful testing. After finishing the 1080 Movement Assessment Specialist course, you will be able to:<br />
                    - understand the body as a whole and how different joints and regions are interconnected in three-dimensional movement patterns and physical performance<br />
                    - know how to systematically test and analyse mobility and stability in various movement patterns<br />
                    - implement an objective measurement tool, 1080 MAP, in order to document mobility and stability in a functional manner for both you and your players<br />
                    - analyse the 1080 MAP profile in order to effectively determine what joint or region is in need of training and rehabilitation<br />
                    - get quick results in your training and rehabilitation due to effective and meaningful testing<br />
                    - be part of our international network<br />
                    <br />

                    - Introduction of integrated biomechanics<br />
                    - Motion analysis<br />
                    - Functional analysis of mobility and stability<br />
