<h1><a name=Foreword></a>Foreword</h1>
<h3>Ezekiel 36:25 - Joel 2:28-32</h3>
<h4>Water Baptism - Spirit Baptism</h4>
<p>The purpose of this web site is to reveal the original intent of both 
 water baptism and Spirit Baptism, and to explain grave errors about baptism 
 that have beset the Christian world since the beginning.</p>
<p>Though surprising we will see that Luke carefully recorded in the book 
 of Acts the fact that the full meaning of baptism was not understood by 
 the very twelve <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Sh'lihim</I></span> (the 
 12 Apostles) for years, and that Apollos, a later successful evangelist, 
 had deficient knowledge as well.</p>
<p>Since the days of Acts further complicating factors have made baptism 
 one of the most controversial issues among Christians.</p>
<p>Without a doubt the single greatest error is the belief that the resurrected 
 Christ commanded a universal water baptism in Matthew 28:19.</p>
<p class=Quote>&quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, 
 baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 
 Spirit.</p>
<p>We will see that Yeshua had not the slightest intent to found a new 
 water rite. Rather Yeshua commanded Jewish <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Sh'lihim</I></span> 
 to purify unclean, idol worshipping first-century gentiles by a true knowledge 
 of the living God of Israel. </p>
<h3 dir=ltr><a name="Salvation is of the Jews"></a>Salvation is of the 
 Jews</h3>
<p dir=ltr>The first followers of Yeshua the Messiah were loyal Jews. They 
 practiced many different Jewish rituals called baptisms. Their Messianic 
 hope was to see the fulfillment of prophecies of the Hebrew Scriptures, 
 certainly including the national purification with pure water in Ezekiel 
 36:25.</p>
<h4 dir=ltr>Ezekiel 36:25 - John's Baptism</h4>
<p dir=ltr>This site proposes that Ezekiel&rsquo;s promised purification 
 to enter the Kingdom is the Scriptural source of the greatest water ritual 
 revealed to Israel, none other than John&rsquo;s end-time Messianic baptism.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Moreover, those first Jewish followers were also promised a change of 
 heart through the supernatural workings of the Spirit in the last days. </p>
<h4 dir=ltr>Joel 2:28-32 - The Supreme Baptism</h4>
<p dir=ltr>The prophet Joel promised an out-pouring of the Spirit on all humble believers in God. Even Ezekiel 36:27 specifies that God would put His Spirit within the people 
 of Israel. Both John the Baptist and Messiah Yeshua described this miraculous event 
 as the <i>Supreme Baptism</i> of the Messianic age.</p>
<p dir=ltr> That wonderful experience 
   was expected and received by those first believers, and not long afterward, 
   by non-Jewish believers who looked to Jewish apostles for guidance. </p>
<p dir=ltr>All knew of a personal experience with the love of God through 
 the out-poured Spirit of God. For the first believers, Spirit baptism, 
 the most magnificent of all baptisms, had also been promised in the Hebrew 
 Scriptures.</p>
<p dir=ltr>On the other hand, the leadership and the greater part of the 
 Jewish nation would not repent, would not receive Yeshua as Messiah and 
 thus could not share in this end-time Gift. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Moreover, only decades later certain circles of Christians abandoned 
 the Jewish backdrop of the New Covenant. As a result they misinterpreted 
 the Jewish Scriptures. Concerning baptism, an experience with water replaced 
 the promised experience with the Spirit and that water baptism, touted 
 as the gateway to God&rsquo;s favor, was based on misinterpretations of 
 end-time promises to Israel.</p>
<p dir=ltr>It is impossible to rightly interpret the crucial details of 
 the New Covenant without factoring in the Messianic aspirations of the 
 Jewish people. </p>
<p dir=ltr>In modern times a growing appreciation of its Jewish character 
 by wide sectors of the Christian world is reversing a centuries-long obsession. 
 Still, recent Jewish scholar Ralph Marcus made a perceptive comment on 
 the teachings of Paul which can be applied to the entire New Covenant.</p>
<p dir=ltr class=Quote>&quot;Perhaps historians of Christianity have not 
 sufficiently appreciated the fact that Paul&rsquo;s...frequent elliptical 
 references to Scriptural narratives...and...rabbinical method of interpretation, 
 would have been practically unintelligible to the gentile members of his 
 audience had there been no learned Jews around to supply the missing links 
 in Paul&rsquo;s involved and hurrying argument.&quot;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p dir=ltr>It is hoped that this book can provide some of those &quot;missing 
 links&quot; for the difficult Jewish subject of baptism.</p>
<p>The Good News was first proclaimed as the direct fulfillment of prophecies 
 to the nation Israel. Unfortunately too many later Christians divorced 
 themselves from the Jewish foundation of New Covenant Scriptures causing 
 no end of harm to the advancement of the Good News of Messiah. Baptism 
 is one of the crucial subjects that must be returned to its Jewish background.</p>

<h3>Recovering the Original Intent</h3>
<h4>by Addressing Theological Errors about Baptism</h4>
<p>To help clear up the confusion about baptism that plagues the Christian 
 world, the following misguided views are addressed at this web site:</p>
<h5>No Christian Water Baptism Ordered by Messiah</h5>
<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	<li class=p><p>The Christian world believes that Christ, after His 
 resurrection, commanded Christian water baptism for all of His followers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though a breathtaking challenge to Christian theology, we will see that 
 <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Yeshua the Messiah</I></span>, known to 
 millions today as <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Jesus Christ, did not 
 command a new </B></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><I><B>water</B></I></span><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B> baptism</B></span>. Rather, He continually and 
 fully endorsed the end-time Messianic baptism to the repentant of the 
 Jewish people, promised in the Hebrew Scriptures, initiated by John, and 
 that was not intended for believers from the nations. <a href="../Messiah_s_Great_Commission/great_commission.htm#Foreword">Go 
 here.</a></p>
<p>Messiah&rsquo;s post-resurrection instructions in Matthew and Mark, 
 which include use of the word baptize, are actually to be understood as 
 meaning something far beyond a water ceremony. Such an interpretation 
 should not be a surprise in light of many of Messiah's symbolic teachings, 
 including, for example, His warning to avoid the &rdquo;leaven of the 
 Pharisees and Sadducees&rdquo; that had nothing to do with physical bread.</p>
<h5>John's Baptism</h5>
<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	<li class=p><p>The Christian world believes John&rsquo;s end-time Messianic 
 baptism for Israel has been superseded by the Christian water baptism 
 supposed to have been instituted by Christ.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This site shows that John&rsquo;s end-time baptism for Israel is the 
 only Messianic water baptism that there ever was. John performed the end-time 
 baptism to reveal Messiah to Israel. The Jewish disciples performed it 
 for new Jewish believers after Messiah&rsquo;s resurrection by the authority 
 of Messiah, i.e.<span style="font-style: italic;"><I> in the name</I></span> 
 of Messiah.</p>
<h5>Ezekiel 36:25 - Basis of Messianic Water Baptism</h5>
<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	<li class=p><p>The Christian world, by and large, does not see John&rsquo;s 
 baptism as the specific fulfillment of end-time promises to Israel. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>This site shows that John&rsquo;s baptism began the fulfillment of the 
 promised end-time purification of the nation Israel, prophesied in the 
 Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament) in Ezekiel 36:25. <a href="../Messianic_Expectations/messianic_expectations.htm#John’s Baptism = Ezekiel’s Purification">Go 
 here.</a></p>
<h5>The Meaning of <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Baptizo</I></span></h5>
<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	<li class=p><p>The Christian world usually takes the word baptize in 
 the New Covenant Scriptures to mean a water ceremony, with many holding 
 the belief that baptize specifically means immerse.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This site shows that in ancient times Jews and Greeks used the Greek 
 verb <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>baptizo</I></span> (baptize) in a highly 
 flexible way to describe various events that caused a complete change 
 in a person or object. Usage was by no means limited to the idea of immersion, 
 much less immersion in water. <a href="../The_Meaning_of_Baptizo/chpte10_baptizo_old.htm#Stupefied by Drugs">Go 
 here.</a> For example, Greeks and Greek speaking Jews like Philo and Josephus 
 wrote that a man drunk from wine was a man baptized.</p>
<p>Philo, On a Contemplative Life</p>
<p class=Quote>&quot;And I know some, who when they become slightly intoxicated, 
 before they are baptized (completely drunk), provide, by contribution 
 and tickets, a carousal for the morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Josephus, Antiquities 10:9:4.</p>
<p class=Quote>&quot;Seeing him in this condition, and baptized by drunkenness 
 into stupor and sleep, Ishmael leaping up, with his ten friends, slays 
 Gedaliah and those reclining with him at the banquet.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jewish people also used the word in a religious sense to describe 
 a change in status before God, which is especially evident in Paul's epistles, 
 and is often associated with the idea of renewed or elevated purity.</p>
<h5>Joel 2:28-32 - Basis of Spirit Baptism</h5>
<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	<li class=p><p>In addition to the many conflicting ideas on the meaning 
 and practice of water baptism between the denominations, the Christian 
 world is deeply divided on the meaning and interpretation of Spirit baptism.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This site shows that God's desire, revealed in the Hebrew Scripture, 
 is to pour out His Holy Spirit of Promise on all who have repented. <a href="../New_Covenant_Supremacy/spirit_mystery_revealed.htm#New Covenant Supremacy">Go 
 here.</a> This sublime, yet powerful miracle was not only anticipated 
 by the first Jewish believers, but was a longed-for personal experience.</p>
<p>All who would seek to enter the Messianic Kingdom must be baptized with 
 the Holy Spirit, an indelibly discernible spiritual experience beyond 
 repentance and distinguished from it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today there are many grievously inept interpretations 
 of Scripture about this powerful experience.</p>
<p>For example, the Sacramental world says that specially-blessed holy 
 water actually bestows the Holy Spirit, holding to the principle of <em>ex 
 opere operato</em>. Sacramentalists hold that infants sprinkled with holy 
 water have in all actuality been baptized with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Other Christians from a Reformed heritage say a person who repented 
 automatically received the Holy Spirit whether he knows it or not, or 
 whether he experienced anything or not. Cessationists believe that after 
 the first century the Holy Spirit is received without an accompanying 
 experience such as miracles like prophesy or &quot;tongues.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet others in Charismatic circles say this spiritual experience is identified 
 primarily by the utterance of &quot;tongues.&quot; In other words, in 
 this widely pervasive view, a person who has uttered &quot;tongues&quot; 
 has been baptized with the Holy Spirit. Promoters of this belief simply 
 encourage congregants to initiate vocal noises and then assure them that 
 they have been baptized with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In contrast to these terrifying &quot;simulations&quot; of divine work, 
 Scripture shows rather that the astonishing experience of being newly 
 filled with the Holy Spirit impelled people to prophesy and praise God 
 by the power and leading of the Spirit. This wonderful order of God's 
 grace in Messiah began on <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Shavu'ot</I></span> 
 (Pentecost), and continues to the present, and for as long as the &quot;last 
 days&quot; continue.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we will see that in Acts the lesson learned by Jewish followers 
 of Messiah in the gentile house of Cornelius is that Spirit Baptism provides 
 the true and ultimate purification before God, not water baptism. This 
 baptism is for all disciples of Messiah and is the universal &rdquo;one 
 baptism&rdquo; mentioned by the apostle Paul. </p>
<h4>A Promised Purification in Ezekiel -</h4>
<h4>A Promised Outpouring in Joel</h4>
<p>This book concludes that God initiated Messianic promises to Israel 
 by sending John to purify Israel with water, beginning the fulfillment 
 of Ezekiel 36:25. In other words, John's baptism <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>IS</I></span> 
 the purification of Ezekiel 36:25. There has never been any other end-time 
 Messianic water baptism. Neither Messiah nor the apostles performed anything 
 other than John's baptism, in other words, Ezekiel's promised purification.</p>
<p>After Messiah ascended into heaven the disciples performed John's purification 
 in Messiah's name and for His sake. Indeed, Messiah had publicly endorsed 
 John's baptism to the leadership of Israel in Jerusalem in the very week 
 before His crucifixion, expecting them to agree that it was &quot;from 
 Heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, John, Messiah, the apostles and all disciples knew that 
 Messiah would perform a much greater purification by pouring out the Holy 
 Spirit, as promised further in Ezekiel 36 and <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>especially 
 in Joel 2.</I></span> Messiah's Spirit baptism is the supreme baptism of this 
 era.</p>
<ul>
  <li> John's baptism remains important for Jewish believers in Messiah.</li>
  <li> Messiah's Spirit baptism is crucial for all believers in Messiah from 
         every nation. </li>
