        <h3>Turn printer off and on after configuration changes</h3>
        <p>The majority of thermal printers require that you turn them off and 
 then back on again before changes to the communication parameters in the 
 printer will take effect. In this regard, keep in mind that some printers 
 need to be left off for about 5 seconds to ensure that they are fully 
 off before you turn them back on. After turning your printer back on, 
 make sure that it has completed its power-on self-test procedure before 
 you start any printing tests. (No lights should be blinking. Additionally, 
 some printers will display the word <span style="font-style: italic;">Ready</span> 
 or display a ready light, usually green.)</p>
        <p>Anytime you output a print job that fails, it is possible that the printer 
 may lock-up, leaving part of a received print job in its input buffer. 
 Because this can prevent the reception of subsequent print jobs, to be 
 on the safe side while trouble-shooting, it is recommended that you power-cycle 
 (turn off and then back on) your printer after failed print jobs.</p>
