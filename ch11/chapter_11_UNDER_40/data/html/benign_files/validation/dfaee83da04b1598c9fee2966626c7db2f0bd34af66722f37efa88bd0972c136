Many times these falls are not serious, but they certainly can lead to a cascade of events that may lead to injury or even death.</p><p> - 60% of people who die from falls are 75 and older<br> - 87% of broken bones in persons over the age of 65 are caused by a fall.<br> - 50% of persons hospitalized after a fall will never be able to live independently again.<br> - Of those hospitalized for a fall only 50% WILL BE LIVING 1 YEAR LATER.</p><p><b>Note: </b>After a fall, an elder may also suffer social isolation and depression because they do not venture out as much secondary to fear of another fall.</p><p>Falls may occur for many different reasons and it takes a comprehensive approach to minimize the potential falls to occur.</p><p><b>Questions you should ask yourself are:</b></p><p> - Have you fallen in past three months?<br> - Is my medication the cause of my falls?<br> - Am I wearing the corrective footwear?<br> - Are my balance reactions appropriate?<br> - Is there another reason for my unsteadiness?<br> - Could your health conditions cause a fall?</p><p>Your Physical Therapist likely wants to know about eye and ear disorders that may increase your risk of falls. Be prepared to discuss these and how comfortable you are walking — describe any dizziness, joint pain, numbness or shortness of breath that affects your walk. Your Therapist may then evaluate your muscle strength, balance and walking style.</p><p>Once a comprehensive evaluation is performed in combination with standardized testing (Tinetti balance and gait tests, Functional reach test, Timed up and Go Test), we can determine your fall risk and begin a individualized program which will be specific to your needs to help maintain your reach your optimal safety with dynamic and static balance.</p><p><b>Things evaluated by a licensed health care professional:</b></p><p> - Vestibular system (inner ear)<br> - Joint Proprioception<br> - Sensation (monofilament)<br> - Strength<br> - Vision<br> - Medication review<br> - Balance strategy preference (Ankle, Hip, Knee)<br> - Home environment evaluation with instructions for corrections.</p><p>I Stride Right will develop this comprehensive program to address all your needs to ensure your safety.

However, with the increased focus on shortening hospital stays, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recognizes the value of this technology in increasing the quality of care for high-risk patients.  In fact, CMS is currently funding a study at Georgetown University using Telemonitoring equipment as the most promising technology available to date.  The purpose of the study is to explore the feasibility of Medicare reimbursing for home monitoring services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;What clinical data can the home monitor collect and transmit?</b></p><p><b>A:&nbsp&nbsp;</b>Daily and PRN measurements can be made of heart rate, blood pressure, weight, oxygen saturation, temperature, blood glucose levels, lung capacity, and prothrombin time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;Which patient should I consider for home monitoring?</b></p><p><b>A:&nbsp&nbsp;</b>Recommended criteria include patients with:</p><p> - Two or more ER visits for exacerbation of a medical problem<br> - Recent hospitalization for exacerbation of an illness<br> - Recent hospitalization for exacerbation of an illness<br> - Poor compliance with diet, medications, or self-monitoring instructions.<br> - Any condition requiring frequent monitoring or trending of vital signs to facilitate care management.<br> - Patients who, if monitored at home, could avoid admission to a nursing home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the exclusion criteria for monitoring services?</b></p><p><b>A:&nbsp&nbsp;</b>The following patient types are not recommended for in-home monitoring:</p><p> - Patients who are physically or cognitively unable to follow simple instructions and have no family member to assist them.<br> - Patients who are combative or have other behavior problems that would limit self-monitoring.<br> - Patients whose environment is not conducive or safe for home monitoring.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;Will monitoring reduce the need for follow-up office visits?</b></p><p><b>A:&nbsp&nbsp;</b>Physicians who have used this technology find the opposite to be true.  Prompt communication of abnormal parameters and routine trend reports allows the physician to detect subtle changes in clinical status before a patient’s condition deteriorates.</p><p><b>This proactive approach to patient management encourages the scheduling of more timely follow-up visits for the purpose of making incremental adjustments to the treatment plan.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p>";
