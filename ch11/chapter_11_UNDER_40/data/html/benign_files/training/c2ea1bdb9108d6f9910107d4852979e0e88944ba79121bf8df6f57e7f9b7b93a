<h3><strong>Enabling/Disabling options</strong></h3><br />

<h3><strong>Disable CSS on any xat chat or profile</strong></h3><br />
To disable/enable CSS on any chat or profile, click on the CSS icon in the address bar.<IMG src="images/NOCSS.png"><IMG src="images/CSS.png"><br />

If you disable CSS on a certain chat or profile and leave it disabled, it will remember your preference the next time you load that chat/profile.<br />
Only 30 chats and profile CSS preferences are stored.<br />
If a chat changes their CSS while you have it disabled, you must re-enable the CSS and refresh the chat to see the new CSS.<br />
<h3><strong>Load below a chat manually</strong></h3><br />
This option is disabled by default. You must enable it. (see Enabling/Disabling options above)<br />
Enabling this option will cancel the loading of the page below a chat if it is set to "Remove page by default".<br />
Clicking on "Load Page Below" will save that preference so when you reload the chat, the page will be loaded automatically. Using "Remove Page Below" will delete that preference.<br />
If you use "Show page by default", all pages below chats will load normally. This is the normal way pages behave on xat.<br />
Clicking on "Remove Page Below" will remove the page and store that preference so when the chat is reloaded, the loading of the page will be cancelled. Using "Load Page Below" will delete that preference.<br />
Only 30 chat preferences are stored.<br />

<h3><strong>Bypass linkvalidator</strong></h3><br />
This option is disabled by default. You must enable it. (see Enabling/Disabling options above)<br />
One domain per line. 1024 characters max. Exclude http:// and/or www. inside of the domain. Enter the domain name and extension only. i.e anything after the forward slash (/) should NOT be included.<br />
Include * at the beginning of a domain to unblock the entire domain. e.g entering *imgur.com will unblock both http://i.imgur.com/abcdefg.png as well as http://imgur.com and any other sub-domains under imgur.<br />
Excluding * means that only that specific domain will be unblocked. e.g entering imgur.com will unblock http://imgur.com/jobs but http://i.imgur.com/abcdefg.png will not be unblocked.<br />
<font color="red"><strong>If you enter a domain that is blocked by xat, it will also be bypassed. You do this at your own risk. Don't add sites you don't trust. Don't unblock entire domains unless necessary.</strong></font><br />
Some recommended examples of domains you should unblock:<br />
*imgur.com<br />
prntscr.com<br />
*wikipedia.org<br />
xatalert.com<br />
xat.la<br />
*tinypic.com<br />
*photobucket.com<br />
youtube.com<br />
youtu.be<br />
<h3><strong>Sideapp</strong></h3><br />
This option is enabled by default. You must disable it if you don't want the app icon showing by the side of the chat. It will not automatically open itself on chat load, so it is not intrusive. (see Enabling/Disabling options above)<br />
When this is enabled, you will see a button on the left hand side of the chat <IMG src="images/sideapp.png"> that will allow you to access this application.<br />
Inside of the application are several xatAlert pages (Get User Info, ID Checker, etc) that resize to fit the application.<br />
