   <IMG SRC="Nicolette3.jpg" HEIGHT=350 WIDTH=268 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Garamond, Verdana, Arial">Nicolette 
   was born in Helena, Montana in 1952. Her father was with the Treasury Department 
   and moved the family's six children to a different U. S. city every two years, 
   exposing Nicolette to diverse styles of music that combined into the unique 
   vocal style that eventually made her into a recording star. Later in life after 
   college, Nicolette got her first break when she was hired as a singer with 
   Hoyt Axton's band and later with Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen. 
   She was soon on her way to becoming one of the top recording and touring vocalists 
   in the business, recording with key musical figures like Emmylou Harris, Linda 
   Ronstadt, Michael McDonald, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffett, Neil Young, Christopher 
   Cross, The Dirt Band, the Beach Boys and the Doobie Brothers.</FONT>

   <FONT FACE="Garamond, Verdana, Arial">Within five years of her arrival in California, 
   Nicolette found herself at the top of the pop chart with "Lotta Love", the 
   Neil Young song that she turned into a classic. This song propelled Nicolette's 
   career into the musical stratosphere. Her subsequent hits, both in the United 
   States and abroad, included "Rumba Girl", "I Only Want To Be With You", "Let 
   Me Go Love" (a duet with Michael McDonald) and "That's How You Know When Love's 
   Right" (a top 10 country single). Nicolette released two critically acclaimed 
   albums (four for Warner Brothers and two for MCA). Her awards included Best 
   New Vocalist by both Cashbox Magazine (1985) and the Academy of Country Music 
   (1984) and Performance Magazines Best Female Vocalist (1979).<BR>

   <FONT FACE="Garamond, Verdana, Arial">Married to the music industry's renowned 
   drummer Russell Kunkel, Nicolette gave birth to Elsie May in 1990. The birth 
   of her daughter inspired the last album she recorded, "SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP," 
   for the SONY WONDER Family Artist Series in 1994. The album is a collection 
   of lullabies and children's songs including duets with Graham Nash and Linda 
   Ronstadt. One of the songs, "Oh Bear" was written with her young daughter, 
   Elsie. In another Nicolette-penned song on that album called "Starlight, Starbright," 
   a heartfelt lyric summed up her feelings toward motherhood and the all-embracing 
   love of a child:</FONT><BR>
