<p><strong>Have you seen Deer Park Estate? </strong>&nbsp;Don't answer too quickly... it's unspoilt beauty has made the area one of the most popular locations in Europe for film and TV productions.</p> 

<p>Occupying almost one hundred acres on the unspoilt western coast of the Hook peninsular of County Wexford, looking out over Waterford Harbor, the Deer Park Estate is directly across the estuary from the picturesque port of Dunmore East.</p> 

<p>Already known to many visitors as a regular stopping off point for cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2, the Hook's extreme Westerly location meant that it was often referred to in the past as 'the next parish to America'.</p>

<div align="center">

</div>

<p>Although the plots are intended purely as souvenirs for your enjoyment, many of our Titleholders have already visited the area to see the Deer Park Estate, to experience the rugged beauty of the Hook Peninsula and welcoming hospitality of the locals at first hand!</p>

<p>Amongst the many historic legacies in the region is the oldest lighthouse in Europe. &nbsp;With its distinctive black and white stripes, the Hook lighthouse was originally founded by the monk Dubh&#225;n in the sixth century.</p>

<p>When you visit your land, you'll find the Templars Inn just a few minutes away where you can relax with a pint of the black stuff opposite an ancient tower of the Knights Templar, and enjoy an unparelleled view across the estuary, especially at sunset.</p>
