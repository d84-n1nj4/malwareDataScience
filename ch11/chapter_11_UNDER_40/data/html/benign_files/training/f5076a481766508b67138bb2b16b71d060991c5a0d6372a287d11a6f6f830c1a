		<h2>Noted</h2>
		<h3>You know those odd thoughts that pop into your head 
		that make you turn on the light in the middle of the night so you can jot them down?</h3>
		<h3>And then you don’t know what to do with that scribbling later?</h3>
		
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<h4>things I figured out for myself</h4>
		<ul>
		<br />
		<li>Some people do not want to solve their problems. A long time ago, a group of us were sitting on some stoops all night, watching fights break out at a bar
		across the street, the police coming and hauling a few people away, the remaining people hanging around until another fight broke out; these 
		people didn't walk away home because this drama was maybe all they had, the highlight of their week.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Things are relative. I may drive by someone house and wonder how they can live like that, while the richest person in town might drive by my house
		and wonder the same thing about me; why don't I get a better job and pay for a nicer house and lawn?</li>
		<br />
		<li>Probably everything that you feel, certainly those things that really really hurt, like a broken heart, profound regret 
		or grief over a loss, has been felt millions and millions of times before by others. (That is what most pop songs are about!) 
		Remembering this tends to make me feel a little bit better, which leads to getting through. This is a cliche, but a very helpful one.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Sometimes I try real hard to see myself as I really am, and I think I succeed sometimes. When this happens, the thrill 
		of clarity almost outweighs the horror.</li>
		<br />
		<li>To explain a piece of modern art, a piece by Warhol for example, it should be seen in a room full of much older art, a lot of Dutch still lifes, 
		say. Not only would both schools of art look better, the virtues of each would be much more apparent. This may seem like a small matter, 
		but if it can explain a Warhol, it could be seen as a big deal!</li>
		<br />
		<li>Sometimes I think about living inside of the perfect house I would like to have built and furnished. 
		On the one hand, I enjoy picturing everything the way I would like it, but then I also picture myself 
		asking “Ok, now what? What do I actually DO here now?” and then I feel another, more real, happiness because I can probably go ahead and do that thing right now,
		here in my old house.
		(Somehow related to that thought is a realization about my partner. If they were perfect, 
		would there be anything there at all? Would I have to look for or create flaws for them that I already have at hand, that are known and managed?)
</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h4>things I have heard and believe to be true</h4>
		<ul>
		<br />
		<li>Televised sports are a cheap substitute for authentic tribal stimulation.</li>
		<br />
		<li>People that are against equal rights for Gays and Lesbians simply fear losing a falsly perceived moral high-ground.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Males are biologically designed to spread seed. While this does not excuse anything, it does explain a lot.</li>
		
		
		
		</ul>

<h4>from a dream:</h4>
	<p>I was in something like the sitting area of some sort of lobby, and not for from me there was a man at a table 
	who I assumed was crazy because he was talking to himself and then I saw there was a woman with him, and he was just memorizing lines from a play,
	and the play was called “How To Say Something In The Hope That The Colonel Will Use It In His Speech Before The Assembly Rather Than In Casual Conversation,”
	and I knew that the play was a gentle “Oscar Wilde/James Thurber” type farce.</p>
		<br />		
	<h4>from a dream:</h4>
	<p>The only thing I brought back from this dream was the name of a not-very-pleasant preppy young man: his name was "Tather Maphews."</p>
		<br />	
<h4>from a dream:</h4>
	<p>A woman said to me, "If you think that you can draw so well, then draw a working camera and take a picture of me."</p>
		<br />				<br />
		
		
		
		<br />	
		
	<h4>idea:</h4>
	<p><em>I guess that this could be a piece of conceptual art, or maybe there could be a story about such a piece (perhaps by someone like JL Borges.) 
	This is probably not an original thought, but I have never run across it in Art History.</em></p>
		<p>There is a piece of art that exists solely in the artist’s mind. The imagined physical object is described in very detailed language by the artist, 
who is of such a stature in the art world that he and the piece are taken very seriously. 
(And maybe more follows…But eventually, a younger important artist imagines an “appropriation” of the piece, and that too is taken seriously,
 even though other lesser artists had tried that before.  
 This would be like a purely conceptual Rauschenberg/de Kooning gesture, 
 a nice description of which I ran across <a href="http://nymag.com/docs/08/05/dekooningpages.pdf" rel=:external">here</a>.)</p>
</p>

	<h4>excerpt from an article:</h4>	
	<p><em>Mark Bittman wrote, in the New York Times, 
	an <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/wendell-berry-american-hero/" rel="external">article</a> about Wendell Berry that included 
	the following paragraph:</em></p>
	<p>"I doubt there is a more quotable man in the United States. (You can readily see this by reading the text of the talk,
	or by visiting <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8567.Wendell_Berry" rel="external">this lovely page of Wendell Berry quotes.)</a> Monday, he spoke of the “mechanical indifference” of a financial trust, 
	that it had the 'indifference of a grinder to what it grinds,' saying, 'It did not intend to victimize its victims. 
	It simply followed its single purpose of the highest possible profit, and ignored the ‘side effects.’' This from a 
	poet and an essayist who, by following his love of the land and its people, describes the current state of affairs as 
	accurately and succinctly as anyone on earth: 'The two great aims of industrialism — replacement of people by technology
	and concentration of wealth into the hands of a small plutocracy — seem close to fulfillment.'”</p>
		
	<br />
	<h4>excerpt from a book, sort of related to the above note:</h4>
	<p><em>From the epilogue of Eric Schlosser’s <b>Fast Food Nation</b> comes this pithy summation and prediction:</em></p>
<p>"The history of the twentieth century was dominated by the struggle against totalitarian systems of state power. 
The twenty-first will no doubt be marked by a struggle to curtail excessive corporate power. The great challenge now facing countries throughout 
the world is how to find a proper balance between the efficiency and the amorality of the market. Over the past twenty years the United States 
has swung too far in one direction, weakening the regulations that safeguard workers, consumers, and the environment. An economic system promising freedom 
has too often become a means of denying it, as the narrow dictates of the market gain precedence over more important democratic values."</p>
<br />
	<br />
	<h4>I wrote a story this morning while waking up:</h4>
	<p>An old man, just sleeping, finally relaxes from his fetal position, rolls over onto his back and just dies.
    <br />Across town, a newborn, just sleeping, becomes uncomfortable and cries, and finally rolls over and curls up on his side and just sleeps.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
<h4>line from sleep:</h4>
	<p><em>(I have no idea what this one meant.)</em>
	<br />
	“Billions of pathetic lives have, through sheer will alone, constructed magnificent monuments that have warmed Gods.
	These mansions are filled with masterpieces of individual accomplishments of genius vision or skill.”</p>
	<br />
	<br />
    <h4>line from sleep:</h4>
	<p>“You are, problematically, accepting as fact that which I, from the bottom of my heart, 
	whisper into your ear while you sleep, that which might should be tempered by the opinion of the general population.”</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h4>excerpt from a book:</h4>
		<p><em>The novels of Alan Furst are fun, all taking place somewhere around Europe sometime around WWII, but this passage in <b>The Foreign Correspondent</b>
		really caught my eye. (I may have been thinking about the attacks of 9/11 maybe not exactly coming out of thin air.)</em></p>
 <p>"But control of the press could have unexpected consequences –Weisz recalled the classic example, the end of the Great War. The surrender of
 1918 had sent waves of shock and anger though the German public. After all, they had read every day that their armies were victorious in the field, 
 then, suddenly, the government capitulated. How could this happen? The infamous <em>Dolchstoss,</em> the stab in the back, <em>that</em> was the reason –political manipulation 
 at home had undermined the brave soldiers and dishonored their sacrifice. So it was the Jews and the Communists, those crafty political guttersnipe, 
 who were responsible for the defeat. This the German public believed. And the Table was set for Hitler.”</p>
 <br />
 <br />

		<h4>quote:</h4>
		<p>"I have made this letter longer than usual, because I lack the time to make it short"
<br /> Blaise Pascal, 'Letters Provinciales' (1657) 
</p>
<br />
 <br />
<h4>overheard in my head:</h4>
		
		<p>"You know that sound that peacocks make when they are asleep and dreaming? It sounded like that."

</p>
<br />
 <br /> 
<h4>suggestion:</h4>
		<p>
		When writing about our government representatives, news sources regularly follow their name with a parenthetical notation 
		of their party affiliation and geographical location. To really inform their readers, they should also include that individual’s 
		largest source of campaign contributions, either a particular company or PAC or general type of industry or union. For example, 
		we would read: “Joe Barton (R., Texas, Oil & Gas.)”  This way we would really know who they are representing. Is there any reason why
		they could not do this?
</p>
<br />
<h4>line from sleep:</h4>
	<p><em>(I have no idea what this one meant.)</em>
	<br />
	“Fierce women any third bootlog rape”</p>
	<br />
	<br />
<h4>line from sleep:</h4>
	<p><em>(I have no idea what this one meant.)</em>
	<br />
	“The matter took a turn and had a turgid end-of-the-world frisson”</p>
	<br />
	
	
	
	<br />
	<h4>just wondering:</h4>
	<p>Would your own death seem less unfortunate to you if you knew everybody else in the world was to die at the same time?
	Would you even want to continue living if everybody else in the world <em>did</em> die at the same time? Can you take comfort knowing
    that everyone <em>will</em> die, just not all at the same time?	</p>
