      <h1>History of Homecoming</h1>
    </div>
    
    
    
    <section class="content main">
        <p>As a valued tradition of University of Minnesota alumni, students, and fans, Homecoming has developed a rich history that is meaningful to many. Various stages of University, Minnesotan, and American history have shaped what Homecoming is today. Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of the history that has shaped our modern-day Homecoming. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Want more history? Make sure to visit our &ldquo;Homecoming Through The Years&rdquo; exhibit located on the basement level of Coffman Memorial Union. Created in 2013 to celebrate the 100th&nbsp;year anniversary, this exhibit features Homecoming buttons dating back to 1922 (courtesy of Don Hickman) and a memorial stadium seat cushion (courtesy of Timothy McDevitt). You will also witness years of Homecoming captured through images and storytelling.&nbsp;</p>
