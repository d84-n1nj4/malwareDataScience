            <h1>Mobile Skin Cancer Clinic</h1>
            <p>Increasingly companies are providing the opportunity for their staff to be screened on an annual basis for skin cancers by medical personnel who are experienced in this area. These measures are significantly lowering the skin cancer risk to the Australian working population.</p>
			<p>All screening and procedural work provided by The Mobile Skin Cancer Clinic is done by doctor's specialising in skin cancer work. Playing our part in the war on skin cancers in the corporate sector, we usually see employees on site resulting in minimum employee downtime for the company and minimum inconvenience to the worker.</p>
			<h3><img src="images/magnify.jpg" width="225" height="204" class="float_left" /></h3>
			<h3>Computerised Screening Equipment</h3>
			<p>Our computerised screening equipment is the best available. All suspicious moles are examined under high magnification using polarised light. Photos are taken and stored where appropriate, so that a record is kept and can be referred to on subsequent examinations, or back in city specialist clinics. Any specimens taken are sent to specialist dermatopathology laboratories for definitive diagnosis.</p>
			<p>There are three main types of skin cancer and some rarer ones.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Melanomas</strong> - Which can travel to other parts of the body and if untreated early have a very high mortality rate.</li>
				<li><strong>Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs)</strong> - Which are generally not as aggressive as melanomas, but can travel to other parts of the body and cause death if not treated in a timely manner.</li>
				<li><strong>Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCCs)</strong> - Which are almost always limited to the site where they first appear; but over a period can cause major skin and deeper tissue destruction.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Melanomas are more common on sun exposed areas but can occur anywhere on the skin and some mucous membranes, even in places unexposed to the sun, such as the soles of the feet, in the mouth and the back of the eye. SCCs and BCCs are nearly always caused by prolonged sun exposure over the years. Sun exposure in the early years does the most harm but all sun exposure is cumulative and potentially disastrous for the well being of the skin. Our outdoor way of life and high UV levels result in the highest skin cancer incidence of any country in the world. Even in those who never get a skin cancer, the quality of the skin deteriorates losing its thickness strength and elasticity.</p>
