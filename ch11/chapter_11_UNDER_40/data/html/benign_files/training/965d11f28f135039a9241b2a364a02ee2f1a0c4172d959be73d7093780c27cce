					<h3>Welcome to BOLT; FREE, INSTANT & PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS</h3>
					<h3>The following is an overview of the project as a whole</h3>
					<h3>Overview Bolt combines the latest advances in cryptocurrency technology to create the first coin that</h3> 
					<h3>can be transacted privately and instantly with no transaction fees. Bolt acheives this through combining</h3> 
					<h3>the block lattice with multiple privacy techniques. By being instant, free, and fungible, Bolt is vastly</h3> 
					<h3>superior to any competitors currently on the market.</h3>
				</div>
<br>				
				<div id="future">
					<h3>Welcome to the Future</h3>
					<h3>Technology Block Lattice Rather than one blockchain, the block lattice creates a new block chain for each</h3> 
					<h3>account that is controlled by the individual wallet. Balances are transacteed through two blocks; a send block</h3> 
					<h3>and a receive block. When sending a transaction, the wallet conducts a small amount of proof of work to prevent</h3> 
					<h3>spamming the network.</h3>
				</div>
<br>
				<div id="priv">
					<h3>Privacy Bolt utilizes three methods to protect privacy.</h3>
					<h3>First, it uses Ring Signatures to hide the addresses of the sender among multiple other addresses, similar to hiding</h3> 
					<h3>in a crowd of identically dressed people. More info about ring signatures is available here and in the Cryptonote</h3> 
					<h3>Whitepaper. Second, Bolt uses stealth addresses to hide the receiving address of a transaction. Stealth addresses are</h3> 
					<h3>disguised addresses where transactions that appear to be going to multiple different addresses are actually going to the<h3> 
					<h3>same one. More information about stealth addresses are available here and in this paper discussing Monero. Third, Bolt</h3> 
					<h3>uses RingCT to hide the amount of a transaction. RingCT allows addresses to verify that an amount is valid while disguising</h3> 
					<h3>the actual amount transacted from third parties.</h3>
					<h3>The privacy features mentioned here are from Monero. Alternatively, privacy features could be taken from ZCash.</h3>

					<h3><bold>ALEXANDER RAFALOVICH JR, FOUNDER</bold></h3> 
					<p>Rafalovich Jr first became interested in Cryptocurrency when he heard about Monero in 2015.</p> 
					<p>The world changing effects of a fungible, private, and global cryptocurrency piqued his interest</p> 
					<p>and led him to study the underlying technology. In 2016, He developed a trading bot that used</p> 
					<p>statistical indicators to switch between different cryptocurrencies. While looking into new coins</p> 
					<p>to trade, he discovered the block lattice technology, immediately saw its potential, and created</p> 
					<p>Bolt. Alexander has a dual BA/BS in Economics and Biology from Hawaii Pacific University and is</p> 
					<p>completing his MFA in Art and Technology at CalArts. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-rafalovich-jr-381442156/">LinkedIn</a></p>

				<a href="#content"><h1><bold>What have we created?</bold></h1></a>
<br>
				<h3>BOLT is the token that will eliminate the need for the fiat world.</h3>
				<h3>How will we accomplish that feat with a mere Token? One in a sea of tokens and coins?</h3>
				<h3>To determine that we must first ask ourselves; What is it that brings people to use crypto?</h3>
				<h1><bold>DECENTRALIZATION</bold></h1>
<br>
				<h3>Crypto is a world without banks and cards and governments.</h3>
				<h3>Crypto is freedom from excess taxation and rules that force us all to allow others to maintain</h3> 
				<h3>control over our money. Bitcoin ended all of that historical control and showed us that WE can</h3> 
				<h3>control our own money; on a grand scale and with great clarity and detail. However, the beginning</h3> 
				<h3>of crypto (Bitcoin) also taught us that the initial freedom comes with a price.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>The ever increasing exchange and mining fees associated with each purchase, sale and transaction</h3> 
				<h3>have become far too high. To solve that problem, and to finally bring everyday money into the</h3> 
				<h3>cryptosphere; we have created the BOLT Token. This token; which we will sell initially for 1BOLT=$0.50USD</h3> 
				<h3>(which translates to value on the BOLT Platform as 1BOLT/$0.45USD; the user's ONLY cost to participate)</h3> 
				<h3>will allow people to tranfer their fiat into a readily usable crypto token. Once the user has purchased</h3> 
				<h3>the BOLT Tokens; they can use them to immediately, and without further fees; to transfer their money</h3> 
				<h3>(in the form of BOLT) to anyone, anywhere.</h3>	
<br>
				<h3>The first crypto, Bitcoin, was meant to be used in this manner. However, due to use of the blockchain</h3> 
				<h3>technology, Bitcoin must be "mined"; costing electrical and computing power; hence; additional cost.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>The BOLT Token elimintates two of the major stumbling blocks presented when trying to use BTC, or, the</h3> 
				<h3>more economical ETH, as currency... Mining fees and transaction time.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>Let's take a look first at the concept of the mining fee.</h3>
				<h3>Bitcoin is an algorithm; a math problem; waiting for someone to solve it.</h3>
				<h3>Unfortunately, even the most skilled human would take months; if not years; to "mine" a block of Bitcoin</h3>
				<h3>So, we use specialized computers and software to speed up those mathmatical calculations.</h3>
				<h3>The beauty of the bitcoin system is that; to get blocks of bitcoins; the miners are actually clearing</h3> 
				<h3>each transaction with that same math. But, again, the complexity of those equations slows the process</h3> 
				<h3>(and insures the cryptography involved). The block lattice technology behind BOLT eliminates the fee</h3> 
				<h3>barrier. There is no fee when using BOLT; only a small fee when purchasing each Token. Add the fact that,</h3> 
				<h3>at any given moment; the BTC blockchain has between 300,000-500,000 unconfirmed transactions; each waiting</h3> 
				<h3>its turn through the calculator. And, let's not forget the CryptoKitties fiasco on the ETH blockchain back</h3> 
				<h3>in December 2017. A flood of users playing a video game hooked to the ETH blockchain through ERC20 tokens</h3> 
				<h3>took transaction times from a few minutes; to a few days for more thn a week. BOLT eliminates that backlog</h3> 
				<h3>and possibiity of a standstill as EACH BOLT Token holds its own blockchain; meaning; every transaction with</h3> 
				<h3>that single BOLT Token will flow instantaneously; leaving its own entry on the lattice of ALL BOLT Tokens.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>But what tech is actually involved in the BOLT Token and platform?</h3>
<br>
				<h1><bold>Block Lattice Technology</bold></h1> 
				<h3>Rather than one blockchain, the block lattice creates a new block chain for each account that is controlled</h3> 
				<h3>by the individual wallet. Balances are transacteed through two blocks; a send block and a receive block. When</h3> 
				<h3>sending a transaction, the wallet conducts a small amount of proof of work to prevent spamming the network.</h3> 
				<h3>Details about the block lattice are available <a href="https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice">here</a>.</h3> 
<br>
				<h1><bold>Privacy Technology</bold></h1> 
				<h3>Bolt utilizes three methods to protect privacy.</h3> 
				<h3>First, it uses Ring Signatures to hide the addresses of the sender among multiple other addresses, similar to</h3> 
				<h3>hiding in a crowd of identically dressed people. More info about ring signatures is available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature">here</a> and in the</h3> 
				<h3><a href="https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf">Cryptonote Whitepaper</a>.</h3>
<br> 
				<h3>Second, Bolt uses stealth addresses to hide the receiving address of a transaction. Stealth addresses are disguised</h3> 
				<h3>addresses where transactions that appear to be going to multiple different addresses are actually going to the same</h3> 
				<h3>one. More information about stealth addresses are available <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/20701/what-is-a-stealth-address">here</a> and in this paper discussing <a href="https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0003.pdf">Monero</a>.</h3> 
<br>
				<h3>Third, Bolt uses RingCT to hide the amount of a transaction. RingCT allows addresses to verify that an amount is</h3> 
				<h3>valid while disguising the actual amount transacted from third parties. More information on RingCT is available <a href="https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf">here</a>.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>The privacy features mentioned here are from Monero. Alternatively, privacy features could be taken from ZCash.</h3> 
				<h3>However, Monero's privacy features are better and thus are included here.</h3>
			</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<div id="risk">
				<a href="#content"><h1><bold>But, What Are The Risks?</bold></h1></a>
				<h3>Every computer program comes with inherent risks.</h3>
				<h3>Everyone knows that there is no such thing as an "unhackable program".</h3>
				<h3>BUT, the beauty of crypto is <bold>Security Through Transparency</bold></h3>
				<h3>What does that mean from a risk standpoint?</h3>
				<h3>The BOLT block lattice, like the BTC and ETH blockchains before it, records <bold>every</bold></h3>
				<h3>transaction made from the birth of each token throughout the life of that token.</h3>
				<h3><bold>Every</bold> BOLT Token holder can see every transaction on every Token through the lattice.</h3>
				<h3>This means that, in order to "hack" BOLT, the attacker would have to attack <bold>every</bold> computer</h3>
				<h3>owned by every BOLT Token holder, every wallet owner, every administrator, and every person connected to the lattice.</h3>
				<h3>That lattice feature, along with our other security features, protect BOLT with the latest, most secure, technologies.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>Aside from the possibility of hacker attacks; the second biggest threat to the BOLT</h3> 
				<h3>project is <bold>governemnt intervention</bold>. The cryptosphere is growing exponentially</h3> 
				<h3>every day. And, it has taken the world's governments some time to bring the laws up to speed</h3>
				<h3>with all of the new technology. Now that the laws are being passed in relation to various cryptos</h3>
				<h3>it has become clear that various governments are somewhat threatened by the cryptosphere; while</h3>
				<h3>others are coming to embrace the "money of the future".</h3>
				<h3>However, at any moment, in any jurisdiction laws may come into effect which could disrupt operations.</h3>
				<h3>To overcome that possibility the BOLT Team constantly monitors the legal world for indications as to</h3>
				<h3>such regulation. We have also structured the BOLT Token, and the entire project, in accordance with</h3>
				<h3>existing laws so as to avoid any entanglements. While the BOLT Team cannot guarantee there will never</h3>
				<h3>be government interference with this project; we can guarantee our quick and appropriate legal response</h3>
				<h3>to any such intrusion on our carefully planned and built system.</h3>
			</div> 
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<div id="market">
				<a href="#content"><h1>But who is our target consumer?</h1></a>
				<h3>The BOLT Token is designed for the general public.</h3>
				<h3>So, that leaves 7+ Billion possible customers buying and using BOLT.</h3>
				<h3>To market to the masses we have developed a very focused introduction to the cryptosphere; the place where</h3>
				<h3><bold>all</bold> tokens are born. The people most likely to initially purchase and use, the BOLT Token</h3>
				<h3>are the people already using crypto.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>In order to attract those initial users we will introduce them to BOLT through the social networks where</h3>
				<h3>crypto projects normally focus their efforts; Telegram, BitCoinTalk, Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook.</h3>
				<h3>From those platforms we can introduce BOLT, explain the project in great detail (which is essential</h3>
				<h3>to the success of <bold>any</bolt> crypto project), and begin taking presales through the BOLT website/platform.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>Once the intial launch is underway within the crypto community the remaining population will hear about BOLT</h3>
				<h3>through word of mouth. Just as BTC grew from its infancy to the media darling it is today; BOLT, with <bold>no fees</bold></h3>
				<h3>will have no problem getting press (especially with our periodic press releases throughout the launch process.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>And, finally, a money transferrence vehicle is nothing without adoption by businesses.</h3>
				<h3>So, along with attracting individuals to use BOLT; we are developing a business platform for accepting BOLT</h3>
				<h3>as a form of payment throughout the regular course of business. This facet of the platform is, in reality, a wallet system</h3>
				<h3>much like any other in the cryptosphere. But, again, the real draw for businesses is the fact that BOLT transfers are instant.</h3>
				<h3>And, with the standard translation of 1BOLT=$0.45usd; the algorithm for the business module will be quite easy to develop,</h3>
				<h3>maintain, and moduify (as BOLT grows and increases in value).</h3>
<br>
				<h3>The commercial value of BOLT as a payment vehicle is that it is free to use, instant to send/receive, and is fully fungible.</h3>
			</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<div id="val">
				<a href="#content"><h1>What is BOLT really worth?</h1></a>
<br>
				<h3>While we all want our own token to reach the proverbial "moon"; the fact is that most tokens don't come close to that mark.</h3>
				<h3>However, of all of the crypto coins and tokens that have made it to the top 10 have two things in common; advanced</h3>
				<h3>cryptography and superior store/transfer of value. BOLT has both of those features in the block lattice and instant, free transfer.</h3>
<br>
				<h3>However, while BOLT has the basics to become the best; what <bold>truly</bold> takes a crypto to the "moon" is the advertising</h3>
				<h3>behind it. With the BOLT Team's multifaceted plan of attack (as outlined above) we believe that the final step of promotions is what</h3>
				<h3>will take BOLT beyond the bottom of the ever-growing population of cryptos to the realm of the kings; BTC, ETH and XRP.</h3>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
