    <p><strong>“Cramps no longer waking me up”</strong><br />
      “I have neuropathy in my foot. To add insult to injury I’d be awaken at night with leg cramps. I was taking a magnesium spray but it was not absorbing. Your magnesium has patched together 6 hours of sleep time by stopping cramping. I like your personal approach and your membership plan helped with the economics but more importantly, your products work!” <br />

  <h1>New “5-in-1” Approach to Energy <br />
    and Blood Flow Boosting Nitric <br />
    Oxide</h1>
  <p><img src="images/pict1.jpg" alt="image" width="100" height="100" hspace="2" align="right" />How could a gas that’s a known air pollutant be crucial to your health?<br />
 <br />
This had many people in the medical community scratching their heads – until a discovery about the importance of this gas resulted in a Nobel Prize in Medicine award in 1998.<br />
 <br />
The gas is nitric oxide, and it helps your blood vessels relax and widen promoting healthy blood flow and vessel flexibility..<em>. </em><a href="article1.php">(read more)</a></p>

    <h1>Dietary Magnesium May Protect Against Age-Related Muscle and <br />
    Bone Loss</h1>
    <p><img src="images/pict2.jpg" alt="image" name="" width="100" height="100" hspace="2" align="right" />As we age, our bodies lose skeletal muscle and bone mineral density. A recent study suggests that consuming more dietary magnesium may help guard against age-related skeletal muscle and bone loss.</p>
    <p>Researchers from the University of East Anglia conducted the study. It was published in the journal Nutrients.</p>
    <p>Participants in the study included 156,575 people between the ages of 39 and 72. The researchers used a computerized 24-hour recall questionnaire called the Oxford WebQ to determine dietary magnesium intake... <a href="article2.php"><br />

    <h1>Q&amp;A with the Staff at NatureCity®</h1>
    <p><strong><img src="../art/dr.Perry.jpg" alt="image" name="" width="72" height="80" hspace="3" align="left" />Q: Can freezing temperatures damage supplements during shipping?</strong><br />
 <br />
A: As long as the product is kept dry, cold temperatures won’t harm the product (unlike sustained high heat, which could cause the product to degrade).  For long term storage at home, we recommend normal room temperature (defined as a range between 59 degrees and 86 degrees) unless the product states otherwise.<br />

    <p><strong class="newsHeaders"><img src="../art/newsBox.gif" alt="bullet" width="12" height="12" /></strong> <strong>High Intensity Exercise Linked to Improvements in Memory.</strong> A study in the <em>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</em> found that individuals who engaged in exercise training for six weeks had a better performance on a high-interference memory task, while no changes were noted in the control group.  Participants who experienced the greatest fitness gains also experienced greater increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports the growth, function and survival of brain cells.</p>
    <p><strong class="newsHeaders"><img src="../art/newsBox.gif" alt="bullet" width="12" height="12" /></strong><strong> Drinking Coffee May Lower Risk of Premature Death and Heart Disease.</strong>  A recent study published in the BMJ examined data from 201 observational studies and concluded that drinking three to four cups of coffee per day may be associated with a lower risk of premature death and heart disease, when compared with drinking no coffee.  The only groups this did not apply to were pregnant women and women at risk of fracture.</p>
    <p><strong class="newsHeaders"><img src="../art/newsBox.gif" alt="bullet" width="12" height="12" /></strong><strong> Astaxanthin Found to Improve Skin Health. </strong> A study published in <em>Nutrition Research</em> found that men and women over the age of 40 who took 4mg of astaxanthin daily for four weeks experienced reduced oxidative stress and improved facial skin health.  The researchers noted an 11% reduction in malondialdehyde (oxidative stress marker) in facial skin at the two-week point and a reduction of 22% at the four-week point.</p>

    <p><strong>Midlife Inflammation Linked to Brain Shrinkage in Later Life.</strong>  A recent study from Johns Hopkins researchers suggests that people with elevated blood biomarkers for inflammation in their forties and fifties may have increased brain shrinkage later in life, potentially increasing their risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.  People with elevated levels of three or more midlife inflammation biomarkers had an average 5% lower volume in the hippocampus and other parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer’s 24 years later, when compared with participants with no elevated biomarkers.</p>
    <p><strong>Study Links Whole Grain Diet to Reduced Body Weight and Inflammation.</strong> Danish researchers found that switching from processed and refined grains to whole grains helps reduce body weight and reduce systemic low-grade inflammation. At the conclusion of their study, blood tests showed that participants had less inflammation in their bodies when they were eating the whole grains. They also ate less when consuming whole grains and generally lost weight, probably because whole grain consumption causes satiety. The increasing popularity of these grains has also increased the range of products available that contain them, such as pasta, sandwich bread, and cereals.</p>
