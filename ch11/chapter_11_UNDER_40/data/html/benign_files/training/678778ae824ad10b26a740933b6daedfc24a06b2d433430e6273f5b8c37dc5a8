<h1 class="western">Entrepreneurship</h1>
<p>Entrepreneurship is the creation of a business from a new idea that people were not used to before.The idea tries to capture a new niche.</p>
<p>The person involved in the creation of this business is known as an entrepreneur. Traditionally, they are involved in acquiring, organizing and rewarding the various factors of production such as labor, land and capital. The ensures that the business process run smoothly.</p>
<p>The businesses of this kind are given a special name called entrepreneurial/entrepreneurship ventures or businesses.</p>
<p>The main target of classical entrepreneurship is the great reward that come as a result of massive expansion, due to the innovative and hardworking nature of the entrepreneur. It is important to note that classical entrepreneurial ventures have to bear a lot of risks in the course of their operation.</p>
<p>Most classical entrepreneurial ventures start small and with time, finance and hard work they expand to become very large business ventures. Some may even become multinational businesses.</p>
<p>Businesses created by classical entrepreneurship play a very big role in the economy. These roles may include: creation of employment, development of infrastructure, development of technology as well as improving the entrepreneurial and hard working culture in the country.</p>
<p>For proper development of a classical entrepreneurship venture, a classical entrepreneur has to be hard working, committed, innovative, sensitive to customers needs, take measurable risks and be goal/result oriented.</p>
<h1 class="western">Small businesses</h1>
<p>In the last decade, however, a new type of entrepreneur has appeared. These new entrepreneurs are not interested in creating a multi – national company: these are businesses whose scale of operation is limited. They are based on existing models that are known to work. This means that these businesses are based on simple ideas that are already tried and tested.</p>
<p>Since these businesses mainly remain small, they may not have such a significant influence in the economy of a country or nation like the classical entrepreneurial ventures. However, they can have a huge impact in the life of the modern entrepreneur, giving him a lot of freedom and money.</p>
<p>Most of the small businesses following this model are based on the Internet.</p>
<p>What are the differences and similarities between classical entrepreneurship and small businesses? Let&#8217;s take a look at them.</p>
<h1 class="western">Similarities between entrepreneurship and small businesses</h1>
<p>1) Both avail goods and services in the economy.</p>
<p>2) They both provide an alternative to employment.</p>
<p>3) They can both contribute to the development of infrastructure and technology.</p>
<h1 class="western">Differences between entrepreneurship and small businesses</h1>
<p>1) Classical entrepreneurial ventures have a very big impact in the economy since most of the successful ones expand and may even become multinationals. On the other hands small businesses only have a small effect that is confined only to a specific locality or area, although with the rapid expansion of the Internet, this is also changing.</p>
<p>2) Classical entrepreneurship kind of businesses are made up of large risk takers who may delve into the business world of unknown. With great risks comes great rewards. Small businesses owners usually prefer to implement only tried and tested ideas and may not take such large risks which may come with uncertainties.</p>
<p>With the rise of the Internet, more and more people are choosing to start their own small business. Are you going to be one of them?</p>

<p>Being an entrepreneur requires some serious skills. You should know how to organize a business and how to manage people. In order to get these skills, you must either learn from credible sources, or have an expert by your side. No matter the method, entrepreneurship brings some serious benefits. Some of the most important ones are mentioned in today&#8217;s article.</p>
<h1 class="western">Being your own boss</h1>
<p>When you work as an entrepreneur, you are responsible for the whole business and its success. At the same time, you are also the only one who decides what will be done.</p>
<p>That is the best benefit of being an entrepreneur. The success of the business depends on higher management. When you are the boss, everything is a matter of your decision. The right approach will lead to the right success.</p>
<h1 class="western">Directing business</h1>
<p>As a boss, you are leading the business to a certain direction. Beginnings are always difficult, but once the business reaches a solid point, everything becomes easier. Directing is simpler and the results are more visible. In order to reach that point, you need a strategic plan that leads to success.</p>
<p>Taking business to the right direction is another more positive thing about entrepreneurship. You can see the progress during the time and the satisfaction is even better when you know that you are the only responsible for that progress. A real entrepreneur knows the next step in every moment. That makes them real leaders.</p>
<h1 class="western">Managing people</h1>
<p>If you are an entrepreneur, you must know some psychology tricks for managing people. This is mostly true in large companies that have a strong hierarchy. Each group member has a specific motivation and you must find it out. What motivates one person might not be the same for another one. With this in mind, your approach should change depending on who you are talking to. Managing people is a serious skill of the best entrepreneurs. They know how to motivate people to give their best performance. This is crucial for the progress, and learning this skill will help you in all areas of your life.</p>
<p>As you can see, being an entrepreneur brings many benefits. You will be able to develop some good skills that promote successful business. If you are the boss, you have freedom and responsibility at the same time. Freedom to organize business and responsibility to direct it the right way are the main features of entrepreneurship. It is not always easy, but entrepreneurship offers great rewards. You develop as a leader and business person. As a result, you earn more money and gain a lot of freedom, which is the crucial reason why most of us want to be successful entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Social media is mainly about sharing any moments of your life, but it doesn’t have to stop there. Many social media accounts use the most common platforms to promote an item, a brand or a celebrity, or even some tasty food. The process of sharing and capturing breathtaking, exquisite photos is now very easy, mainly thanks to Social Media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and many others. In this article we will focus on how to take good pictures for Instagram.</p>
<h1 class="western">Instagram: the basics</h1>
<p>Instagram is one of the top sharing social media platforms. It became popular because of how easy it is to share photos and videos there. Many account users took Instagram very seriously; lots of them produce high-quality photos using smartphones and share them with the world.</p>
<p>You may already know how to take good pictures for Instagram of a freshly baked mac and cheese, or perhaps a photo of a scenic view of mountains or even a day to day activity, but, what if you want to take really good pictures for Instagram? How to take it to the next level?</p>
<p>There are many techniques that can be applied to capture great Instagram worthy photos. But let us take a closer look at the basic techniques to improve your abilities as an Instagram photographer.</p>
<h1 class="western">Story</h1>
<p>You need to picture out on your mind on what to capture, what is the story that you want to convey in your photos. This technique is just like sketching the things you want in your masterpiece, before even starting to paint.</p>
<h1 class="western">Setting up your camera</h1>
<p>Your camera will be your main tool while taking an Instagram picture. Whether you will be using your phone or a digital camera, you need to know its capabilities, and what are the settings that can be used.</p>
<h1 class="western">Photography Techniques or Composition</h1>
<p>In order to achieve the best possible picture, you need to know something about the basic things like the rule of thirds, bird&#8217;s eye view, worm&#8217;s eye view, and lighting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule of Thirds → It is one of the basic techniques. Using imaginary lines, you break the screen of the camera in three vertical sections, as well as three horizontal ones. Thus, you obtain a 9 – square grid. The idea is to place the thing you want to capture in the intersection points of the imaginary lines to give it more body.</li>
<li>Bird’s eye view → This technique consists of taking the photos above the subject, to give them a more dramatic aspect.</li>
<li>Worm’s Eye View → The opposite of the last technique, it involves taking photos below the ground and emphasizing the size of the objects.</li>
<li>Lighting → A good lighting can make the difference between a good picture and a bad one. It can be natural (sunlight), as well as artificial, like the one in a studio.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="western">Post Production Editing</h1>
<p>Post production is necessary to get the highest possible drama for your photo. It is used to eliminate and to add light or darken a photo, to blur some parts or even to create illusions within your photo. With Instagram, the post production process is done mostly by using filters.</p>
<p>In the end, if you want to know how to take good pictures for Instagram, it is not about using the most high-end camera or smartphone; but rather about how you can take a normal scene to the next level.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to earn money from your photographic skills, then you must have a portfolio website so you can showcase your creative side to the world. One of the most popular type of picture nowadays is the self portrait photography.</p>
<p>In this article, we will see the most important tips for self portrait photography that will help you to improve and enhance the pictures you take of yourself.</p>
<h1 class="western">Preparing for the self-portrait</h1>
<p>A bit of preparation is required when you wanna take the best shots. Even the best photographers in the world have everything prepared beforehand in order to achieve perfection. So if you want to look like a model in your selfie, then you should approach your shoot in the same manner.</p>
<p>In order to do a great self-portrait photography, you need several things: a digital camera, a suitable background, and a selfie stick or a tripod if needed. You could also use the camera built in your smartphone, but the quality of the pictures will not be as satisfiying.</p>
<h1 class="western">Location of the shoot</h1>
<p>When you are ready to take your picture, you must find a plain background; it might be gray, cream or white if you want it to look like it was taken in a studio. Another option for informal pictures is tu use a more natural background, but this photo is about you so avoid distracting elements in the back. For example, leaves and flowers are fine, but do not include lots of objects and colors; otherwise people will not look at you, and just see the background.</p>
<p>There are some more tips for self portrait photography if you wanna do the shoot indoors: for example, you can use curtains as a background. Also, depending on the color of your sking, bright colors would work lovely for the background. Experiment with some different shades of colors to see which one makes you look better: different shades of blue, red, etc.</p>
<h1 class="western">How to take the picture</h1>
<p>There are basically three options that you can choose from when taking your pictures.</p>
<p>The first one would be tu just hold the camera with your arm stretched, and keep pressing the shutter while you strike your pose. This is perfect if you have no access to a selfie stick or a tripod, but the quality of the pictures taken will be lower. For the shots taken using this technique to be better, you can place the camera above you and look up; this will make you look better in the pictures.</p>
<p>Another option involves using a selfie stick. Here, the camera will be farther appart from you, so the pictures taken will capture not only your face but also part of your body and your background.</p>
<p>The last option is to buy a tripod or place the camera in a stable surface before taking the picture. Most cameras nowadays have a timer option, so you can use it; if you don&#8217;t have a remote control, this is the next best option. Of course, I would recommend getting a remote control eventually, as they are not too expensive. If you set your camera&#8217;s timer to have a delay of around 5 to 15 seconds, you&#8217;ll have enough time to get in the frame, strike a pose and let the magic happen.</p>
