<b>Read about Our Mission!&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 
</p>
<p>
Central Jersey Dance Society (CJDS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to promoting&nbsp;social dance and its many human and cultural rewards.&nbsp; CJDS&nbsp;is completely managed by a volunteer, unpaid board of trustees. All board members are employed in non-dance professions and dedicate&nbsp;their efforts as a small but joyful gift to the community. 
</p>
<p>
**We&nbsp;offer many events including local performances,&nbsp;free outdoor dances in Princeton, free lessons in Plainsboro, holiday dance parties, and&nbsp;a variety of inexpensive but&nbsp;well-received dance lesson series comparing to regular dance studios. CJDS&nbsp;provides&nbsp;a diversity of social dance experience (Latin, Ballroom, Swing, etc.) in the&nbsp;central Jersey area.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
**CJDS makes&nbsp;contributions to outstanding humanitarian&nbsp;causes and to the local community. Recent examples are:&nbsp;$500 donated&nbsp;to UNICEF for Haiti disaster relief, and a total of $800&nbsp;donated to the Suzanne Paterson Senior Resource Center to assist with various repairs. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Thank you for supporting our events and making it all&nbsp;possible!</b>
</p>
<p>
Sincerely.
</p>
<p>
Irina Signotovich, CJDS President&nbsp;

&nbsp; 


&nbsp;


Born in Manhattan but raised in Ecuador, Mike moved to West New York, New Jersey in his early teens. He was first introduced to salsa in 2000. By 2001, his passion for dancing led him to become both a performer and&mdash;with his background in teaching&mdash;an invaluable dance instructor. 


Through dedication, creativity and skill, Mike quickly earned the reputation as one of the East Coast's finest. His soft lead and smooth movements make him a popular choice among the ladies, while his unique styling and shines make him the envy of gentlemen. His knowledge in Latin dancing spans beyond salsa and includes other popular styles such as Mambo, Bachata, Cha-cha-cha and Casino Rueda. He has traveled extensively, performing at Salsa Congresses both locally and internationally. 







Look for the large crowds in the salsa scene, and you'll find Mike Andino teaching in the center. His inspiration is evidenced by his large following. Whether a student is 5 or 85, Mike is known for helping the beginner-level dancer feel comfortable and confident, while always reinforcing his most important rule: to have fun. 


Although always smiling, Michael works hard and takes his career seriously. His drive and motivation led him to become a founding member of Art in Motion Latin Dancers in 2004. Later that year, he launched the successful children's dance group Kids Con Estilo

By 2006, Michael's motivation led him to open his own studio, Estilo Dance Studio, in Philadelphia , PA, where his passion for teaching and dancing continues today.
