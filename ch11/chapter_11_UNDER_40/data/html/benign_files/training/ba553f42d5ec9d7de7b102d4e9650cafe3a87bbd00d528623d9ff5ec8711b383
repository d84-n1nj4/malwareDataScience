									<li>
										You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us, our parent corporation, officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your access to or use of ByteFence; (ii) your violation of these Terms; or (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, or privacy right.

								Governing Law and Disputes.
								<ul>
									<li>
										This Agreement will be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of New York, without regard to its conflicts of law principles or provisions.   The parties specifically exclude from application to this Agreement the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.  Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be exclusively settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC Rules”) by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules (the “Arbitrator”). The arbitration shall take place in New York and shall be conducted in the English Language. The arbitration shall be conducted on a confidential basis. The award passed by the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties. Nothing contained herein shall prevent either party from applying to any court of law in order to obtain injunctions, equitable relief or any equivalent remedy, against the other Party, in order to restrain the breach of any restrictive covenants pursuant to this Agreement. The arbitration award shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Any motion to enforce or vacate an arbitration award under this agreement shall be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible.  Accordingly, for any claim that you have with us, you agree, prior to filing any suit or proceeding, to first contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending us a written notice of your claim (“Notice”). If you and we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, then either party may file a claim in court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION THAT YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO BYTEFENCE OR THESE TERMS MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

								General.

										These Terms constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the matters referred to herein. The Section headings in these Terms are provided for convenience purpose only and have no legal or contractual significance. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any rights or to take action against you in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of such rights or of subsequent actions in the event of future breaches. These Terms and any right granted herein may not be assigned by you without our prior written consent. The controlling language of these Terms is English. In the event of inconsistency or discrepancy between the English version and any other language version, the English language version shall prevail. Nothing in these Terms will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship between you and us, and you do not have any authority to create any obligation or make any representation on our behalf.
