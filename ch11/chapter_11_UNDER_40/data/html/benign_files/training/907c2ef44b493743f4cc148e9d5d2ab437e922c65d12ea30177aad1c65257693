	    Sade to his wife.<BR>
	    [July 27, 1780]<BR>
	    <BR>
	    Well! there you are in your profound silence... That is well done; it is
	    right sometimes torest upon one&#146;s laurels. I am going to do the same
	    thing, as you will find out. But the difference between us two is that I
	    myself have nothing to say, and that consequently it is utterly pointless
	    for me to write; but you, on the other hand, if you were willing, or if you
	    were able, you would have a lot to say. Take careful note that I say: If
	    you were able, and let this make you clearly see that I am treating you fairly,
	    and to what a degree I am persuaded that you are as much constrained to perform
	    the nonsense that they make you do, as I am to receive it. Let this make
	    you see clearly once and for all, that through all this, my feelings for
	    you will never change. My portion of hatred is not divisible; I would be
	    too afraid that it would diminish by being shared, and I too much crave keeping
	    it whole for her who deserves it most.<BR>
	    <BR>
	    Despite all your kindnesses and all the lovely signals, my health is considerably
	    deteriorating. It is impossible for me to live without taking the air, especially
	    during this season. I am completely unable to eat or to sleep. When preventing
	    me from taking exercise, they should at least leave me undisturbed at night.
	    But to make me suffer dreadful headaches all day long by depriving me of
	    sleep, and to keep me from taking the air, which is the only thing that can
	    relieve them, this amounts to giving me every sort of suffering at the same
	    time, and this lovely treatment I rather think I shall never forget. So send
	    me, at least, the flask of eau de Cologne that I askedyou for a long time
	    ago: if I had had it here with me all those days I so much suffered from
	    nerves and from headaches, it would have helped me a lot. You will admit,
	    that this is a perfect example of petty, gratuitous harassment--to refuse
	    me even this slight assistance. Ah! what a fine lesson all that teaches me!
	    and how I will profit by it! Always remember that I would much prefer to
	    dash my brains against these walls than not to some day force your execrable
	    mother into saying: &#147;He is absolutely right; I repent of it. In dealing
	    with that sort of personality, it was wrong to act in that way.&#148; <BR>
	    <BR>
	    I was really convinced the other day not only how much they want me to suffer,
	    but even how much they would be heartbroken if an illness interfered with
	    all the wickedness they heap on me here. By actual count, I have spent seventeen
	    nights without for a single minute closing what is called an eyelid. I was
	    like a veritable corpse, to the point of making me afraid to look at myself.
	    The surgeon comes to ask me how I am. &#147;My looks will tell you better
	    than I can,&#148; I reply. &#147;But no... not at all. In fact, you look
	    wonderful,&#148; he says. Good, I say to myself, that is all I need to fully
	    convince myself that this fellow sees me exactly like the surgeon of the
	    Inquisition who takes the pulse during the torture in order to determine
	    if one can bear it longer,and who invariably says: &#147;Continue.&#148;
	    My surgeon (I truly believe it) has an order to report how I appear; but
	    have no illusions: he fully understands, from the manner in which they speak
	    to him, that they very much want his report to prolong the torture? By means
	    of which, this fellow, to whom this essentially matters nought, always reports
	    that things are fine, as long as he does not see me suffering a fatal
	    seizure.<BR>
	    <BR>
	    Moreover, for themselves, bear in mind that all these wicked people have
	    their own interest in deceiving the families, and so they do it; in a word,
	    the most horrible abuses which, under cover of this fine secrecy, are daily
	    committed in these prisons, are one of the things that ought most deserve
	    the attention of people with influence, if there really were justice in France
	    and if those concerned did not have a much greater interest in stifling protest
	    with gold or with pretty girls. Everything is fine, all is well, everything
	    is the best possible when there is a girl in your bed and money in your pocket.
	    Gold and c[unts], there you have the gods of my country, and would I stay
	    in France, I, who will never have a lot of the former and who will be extremely
	    ashamed to debase myself to the point of prostituting the latter in those
	    so closely related to me?... No, no, I will not stay here!... I swear it,
	    I would rather go and live in Japan; I would certainly meet with more honesty
	    there and I would certainly not see so many horrors... And besides, do they
	    punish over there? Just once in my life, I would love that, in fairness,
	    they compare the life of the unfortunate victims they imprison here, with
	    the wicked deeds of those who keep them behind bars, and then let them see
	    which ones better deserve to carry the keys to the doors! A bit of bad luck,
	    an indiscretion, some treachery by lackeys or friends on the one hand, compared
	    to a thousand injustices, a thousand abuses, a thousand atrocities on the
	    other, but which one is covered up and which one&#146;s reputation is
	    destroyed?...<BR>
	    <BR>
	    Here are a lot of books I am returning to you. Two volumes of the abb&eacute;
	    Pr&eacute;vost, the restof M. d&#146;Alembert... What a man! what a style!
	    These are people I would have for arbiters and for judges, and not the idiotic
	    gang that dares to govern me! I would have no trouble being exonerated by
	    judges like these, because one has as little to fear when the matter is in
	    the hands of Philosophy holding the scales, as one ought to tremble when
	    one sees it in the hands of bigotry and greed... In addition, the two first
	    volumes of the C&eacute;r&eacute;monies; I am sending it to you pretty fast,
	    it seems. I never told you that this was a book to be read in a fortnight,
	    and I could see quite clearly, when you sent it to me, that this was a clever
	    device by which you would have me know that I still had a long time to suffer
	    here. But by now I am used to all your stupid nonsense; I am bored by it;
	    all that no longer bothers me at all. It remains to be seen if a proper way
	    to improve a man is to shrivel up all the sensitive faculties of his soul;
	    and notwithstanding your C&eacute;r&eacute;monies, they have so little upset
	    me that I will undertake--if that is what is wanted--to leave here only when
	    they are read: proof that my estimate of my sentence is on the high side,
	    and has ever been so. [As to] the rest of the books that I still have here,
	    [I] will not read them in a rush. I am warning you about this, because they,
	    along with the C&eacute;r&eacute;monies, can only be books for serious reading.
	    So it will go slowly. As to books for my light reading, all I have is your
	    Troubadours: that will take about two weeks, that is, until August 15. I
	    am asking you, for the aforesaid light readings, to look, together with Amblet,
	    for some novels, both very interesting and philosophical,but, above all,
	    not too black or too melancholy, utterly detesting both of these extremes.
	    Once again: some novels, because at night here, it is absolutely impossible
	    to undertake any serious reading.<BR>
	    <BR>
	    For the 1st of next month: one cake of marsh-mallow (not syrup) and above
	    all, I entreat you, my flask of eau de Cologne; do not forget it, I ask it
	    of you as a favor. If you would like tosend some figs, they would give me
	    pleasure: last year, the ones you sent at around the same season, as far
	    as I can recall, arrived in good condition and did me a lot of good. I leave
	    you free to repeat your generosity, and I beg you not to forget me when the
	    fine peaches of Chartreux are in season.<BR>
	    <BR>
	    Moreover, you will deeply put me in your debt by obtaining permission for
	    me to take the air, because I tell you a thousand times that I am suffering
	    horribly by lack of exercise and that it is a disgrace to deprive someone
	    of the benefits belonging to every creature. Could not an over-abundance
	    of benefits also serve to send a signal? and would it not also be clever
	    and moving whereas that other method would not be? Amidst filth and grime
	    neck-high, bitten by bedbugs, by fleas, by mice, and by spiders, served like
	    a pig because the promptitude with which they scurry out of my room as soon
	    as they have brought me my food never allows me either to remember or the
	    time to ask what I need, and the three scullions of our innkeeper always
	    ready to shoot off as soon as they open my door, is all of that not lovely,
	    does all of that not add up to a delightful signal?... a truly touching and
	    poignant signal? Do you really have to add to this the torture of the pneumatic
	    air-extractor [alluding to the denial of his taking the air, or perhaps to
	    his faulty stove]? I will not mention my hair, which is falling out since
	    one of these signalling episodes involved my no longer taking care of my
	    hair: I will not mention anything about this because I am no longer vain
	    about my hair, thank God, and because when I get out of here I will certainly
	    take to wearing a peruke... That is a good definite...<BR>
	    <BR>
	    And really, my best friend, am I not mature by now?... No more illusions--I
	    had them these forty lovely years following which I promised to renounce
	    Satan and all his pomp and pretense... Now I am past forty, it is time to
	    begin, little by little, to acquire a slight pallor of the grave: one is
	    less surprised when it comes when one is prepared for it... So let it come,
	    let it come when it will; I will wait for it, neither desiring it nor fearing
	    it. It is only those who are favored by fortune who regret leaving this life;
	    but those who, like me, count their years only by their misfortunes, do not
	    have cause to look upon the moment of annihilation except as the happy occasion
	    of the breaking of their chains. May the dear friend who alone could still
	    sweeten my last days spare me the grief of surviving her, and may those
	    unfortunate souls who owe their existence to us be able to enjoy it more
	    than us! These are the only prayers that I still dare to ask God, and the
	    only ones whose granting would cause some roses to bloom on the thorns of
	    my life.
