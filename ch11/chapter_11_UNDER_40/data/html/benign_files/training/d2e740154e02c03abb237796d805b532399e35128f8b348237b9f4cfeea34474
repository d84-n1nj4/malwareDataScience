<h5 id="blox-asset-title">Survey bodes well</h5>
<p>FREEPORT – A survey of Freeport businesses this month by FreeportUSA to assess the 2013 retail and tourism climate revealed promising signs.</p>
<p>Fifty-five percent of respondents reported that business was up from 2012, with 25 percent reporting sales spikes of more than 3 percent.</p>

<h5 id="blox-asset-title">GUEST COLUMN – Promoting Freeport far and wide</h5>
<p>I’m often asked what we do and who we are. Like anyone running a small company or nonprofit, you think about your desk covered with piles of important to-do lists and sticky notes with the day’s most important reminders, all of which track back to the mission. But to get to the big picture, I have to return to the charge our members gave us – promote Freeport as a destination for visitors.</p>
<p>But, that one-line description just doesn’t do our organization justice. Established in 1977 by Freeport business leaders, we have evolved from an organization of member merchants to the premier organization dedicated to marketing Freeport for destination travel and serving the information needs of visitors. FreeportUSA serves the interests of our members by serving the best interests of the Freeport community and our millions of annual visitors.</p>

<p>FREEPORT – The Freeport USA board of directors is welcoming new Executive Director Janet Dutson, who recently joined the organization.</p>

<h5>Historic Freeport eatery up for sale, could reopen</h5>
<p>Janet Dutson, executive director of Freeport USA, which is the local merchants association, bemoaned the restaurant&#8217;s closing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always a loss when a business that has that much name recognition with Freeport closes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived in Maine my entire life, and, like L.L. Bean, the Jameson Tavern is synonymous with Freeport.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dutson said Old Navy plans to open a new store in Freeport Village Station, a downtown shopping center, and a brewery is building a new facility on Route 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are looking really good in Freeport,&#8221; Dutson said. &#8220;We&#8217;d all love it if another form of the Jameson Tavern took over that spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>FREEPORT – With the announcement that Amtrak’s Downeaster service to Freeport will be chugging into the station on Nov. 1, the town is anticipating the economic shot in the arm that many think the train will bring.</p>
<p>“We’re so excited about (the Downeaster’s arrival),” said Janet Dutson, the executive director of FreeportUSA, the local merchants’ group. “Because they (Amtrak) are going to be putting $65,000 (in advertising) in the greater Boston metro area about the train trip to Freeport. So that is going to get a bunch of people on board.”</p>

<p>“It has been a problem,” said Janet Dutson, executive director for FreeportUSA, an organization that markets the town as a tourist destination. “People arrive with their bags and have no place to put them. It’s certainly an inconvenience.”</p>
