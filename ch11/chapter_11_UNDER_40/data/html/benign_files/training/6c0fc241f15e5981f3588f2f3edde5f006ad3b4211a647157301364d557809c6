<p>Welcome to Guisborough Tennis Club. We are a family friendly, relaxed, and affordable club. 
We have 4 hard courts, recently re-surfaced with the help of <a href="http://www.sportengland.org">Sport England</a>, which are available for members to play on without booking for the vast majority of the time. Here is a link to a <a href="timetable.html"> timetable </a>with all the details.</p> 
<p>The club competes in the  <a href="http://www.cleveland-league.com"  >Slazenger Cleveland League</a>, (doubles), and currently fields a ladies team, a mixed team, and 3 men's teams.
We are proud to say that some of our best young players competing in the league are products of our club system.</p>
<p> There are 2 afternoons and 1 evening devoted to informal doubles, when people can mix in and get to know the other members.
</p>
<p>Now we also have a very highy qualified and respected coach in <a href="coaching.html">Mark Franklin</a>, providing expert group and individual coaching for all ages. </p>

<h2>     New 2016 Season</h2>
<div>
<p><h3></h3></p>
<p>With the team practice nights now underway, the new season feels well and truly open.</p>
<p>Because of the withdrawal from the league of the two Acklam teams, our Mens B team will not now be relegated,
 so we now have a second try to establish ourselves in Division 3.</p>
<p>The new season set up, resulting from the AGM, has been summarised as usual by Howard (sec) in a single file, and sent to members.
 These details can be viewed <a href="2016.html">here</a> and the file is also available as a <a href="2016details.doc" download>download</a>.</p>

<h2>    2015 Round Up</h2>


<div>

<h3>     Cleveland League Season</h3>

<p>The 2015 season saw our three newly promoted teams begin in a new division, with mixed results.

The ladies team found life in Division 1 tough going and were relegated.
The men's first team consolidated their position in the second division finishing in 4th place.
The men's second team struggled in division 3 and were relegated.


</p>
<p>


We also fielded a new team,the men's third team, consisting of juniors captained by Russel Smith.  In their debut season in the league they were
 were promoted from division 6 to division 5. Congratulations to them!
</p>
<p>
The mixed team, after a strong season, narrowly missed promotion to division 1
</p>




<h3>   Autumn </h3>
<p>
In September our Club Chair, Moira Smith, was honoured at the 2015 Durham & Cleveland County LTA Awards Ceremony.
 Moira was nominated in the Meritorious Award for Lifetime Service as a Volunteer to Guisborough Tennis Club and was the winner! 
She was presented with her award at the ceremony at Sunderland Football Club's Stadium of Light. Congratulations to Moira!
</p>

<p>
In October Paul Mason, our first team captain, successfully revived the long dormant club singles championship.
There were some notable performances from our junior boys, with  Ethan Bartkiw and Mathew Smith deserving a special mention.
Even more impressively, 15 year old Lois Page won the whole event in fine style against the strongest men players in the club.
 Potential local sponsors take note!
<p>Thanks to everyone who took part, and a big thanks to Paul for organising such a successful event.</p>
