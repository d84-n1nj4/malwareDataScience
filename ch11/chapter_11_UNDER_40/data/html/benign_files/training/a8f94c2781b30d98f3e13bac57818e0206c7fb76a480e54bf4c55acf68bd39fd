jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in
them  as  in  the  depths of a mathematical problem -- delicate
pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you  except
your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of
what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this kind
of  thing.  On  occasion  he  had  even been entrusted with the
rectification of The Times leading articles, which  were
written  entirely  in Newspeak. He unrolled the message that he
had set aside earlier.  It  ran:

In  Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:
The reporting of Big Brother's Order for the Day in  The  Times
of  December  3rd  1983  is  extremely unsatisfactory and makes
references to non-existent persons.  Rewrite  it  in  full  and
submit your draft to higher authority before filing.
Winston  read through the offending article. Big Brother's
Order for the Day, it  seemed,  had  been  chiefly  devoted  to
praising  the  work  of  an  organization  known as FFCC, which
supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the  sailors  in  the
Floating  Fortresses.  A  certain  Comrade Withers, a prominent
member of the Inner Party, had been  singled  out  for  special
mention  and  awarded  a  decoration,  the Order of Conspicuous
Merit, Second Class.
Three months later FFCC had suddenly been  dissolved  with
no  reasons  given.  One  could  assume  that  Withers  and his
associates were now in disgrace, but there had been  no  report
of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen. That was to be
expected,  since  it  was unusual for political offenders to be
put on trial or  even  publicly  denounced.  The  great  purges
involving  thousands  of people, with public trials of traitors
and thought-criminals  who  made  abject  confession  of  their
crimes  and  were afterwards executed, were special show-pieces
not occurring oftener than once in  a  couple  of  years.  More
commonly,  people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party
simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had
the smallest clue as to what had  happened  to  them.  In  some
cases  they  might  not  even  be  dead.  Perhaps thirty people
personally known to Winston,  not  counting  his  parents,  had
disappeared at one time or another.
Winston  stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the
cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson  was  still  crouching
secretively  over  his  speakwrite.  He  raised  his head for a
moment: again the  hostile  spectacle-flash.  Winston  wondered
whether  Comrade  Tillotson  was  engaged  on  the  same job as
himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece  of  work
would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand,
to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an
act  of  fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a
dozen people were now working away on rival  versions  of  what
Big  Brother had actually said. And presently some master brain
in the Inner Party would select this  version  or  that,  would
re-edit   it  and  set  in  motion  the  complex  processes  of

rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he
had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
business?"
"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per
cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can
only touch the interest."
"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so
large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the
bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in
every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely
upon an income of about 60 pounds."
"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while
I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the
time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I
earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can
often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as
freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked
nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets
when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and
sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I
wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I
was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing
fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much
as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,
he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,
mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it
was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from
France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a
gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if
we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to
say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father
came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
any more."
