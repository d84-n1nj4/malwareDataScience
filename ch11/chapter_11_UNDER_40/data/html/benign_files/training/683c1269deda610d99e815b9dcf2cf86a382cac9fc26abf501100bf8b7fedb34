  <p><b>To open the File Settings</b> choose '<a href="menu_options.htm">Options > File settings</a>' from the main menu or press the <b>F10</b> function key on your keyboard. The <b>File Settings</b> page allows you to link additional folders into the <a href="browser.htm">Browser</a>, along with a location where your VST/VSTi plugins are saved. You can then directly access
    these files from the FL Studio Browser. <b>To open:</b> Press <b>F10</b> and select the File icon. The first time you open this page, the folder slots will be empty, each row represents one 'custom' folder
    that you can add to the Browser. Folders set here also be searched (and all sub-folders) for samples and sounds when you load a project. It is unwise to select the root of your C: drive for 
    example as FL Studio will search all the folders on your hard-drive when it is looking for a file.
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> At any time you can open a standard Windows Browser (Right-click on the Windows 'Start' button and select 'Explore') and then drag compatible files from the Windows Browser into FL Studio
    (FL Studio will behave in the same way as noted in step 1 below).

<a id="Filesettings_Autosave"></a>
<h3>Backup (Autosave)</h3>

  <p>The Autosave function will create backup copies of the <b>current project</b> (and/or any <b>overwritten</b> files including .flp, .fst, .zip etc) to the <b><a href="browser.htm">Browser</a> >
      Backup</b> folder. This folder is located in FL Studio's installation directory <b>..:\Program Files (x86)\Image-Line\FL Studio\Data\Backup</b>. If you want to recover the last autosave then use the option '<b>Revert to last autosave</b>' from the <a href="menu_file.htm">File Menu</a> OR select a project from the <a href="browser.htm">Browser</a> > Backup folder. Autosaves are made according to the following settings and rules:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Never (just remind every 10 min)</b> - No backup files are made. The reminder to save your project will appear in the <a href="panel_main.htm#HintBar">Hint Bar</a> if 10 minutes elapse without a manual save.
    <li><b>Rarely (every 15 minutes)</b> - Backups are made on every manual save AND every 15 minutes UNLESS FL Studio is playing, then the autosave is postponed until the project is stopped.
    <li><b>Occasionally (every 10 minutes)</b> - Backups are made on every manual save AND every 10 minutes UNLESS FL Studio is playing, then the autosave is postponed until the project is stopped.
    <li><b>Regularly (every 5 minutes)</b> - Backups are made on every manual save AND every 5 minutes UNLESS FL Studio is playing, then the autosave is postponed until the project is stopped.
    <li><b>Frequently (every 5 minutes & before risky operations)</b> - Backups are made on every manual save AND on critical operations AND every 5 minutes, even when FL Studio is playing and before adding plugins.
  </ul>
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> Only the last 20 saves & or auto saves for all projects that you have been working on are retained. The purpose of this system is for emergency recovery of crashed, damaged or
    incorrectly edited projects. For <b>permanent sequential backups</b> use the (<span class="KbdShortcut">Ctrl + N</span>)
    save shortcut or select <a href="menu_file.htm">File > Save new version</a>.

<h3>Plugins (VST)</h3>
  <p><b>Virtual Studio Technology (VST)</b> is a software interface standard that allows you to load VST software synthesizer and effect 'plugins' in FL Studio. VST is in addition to the FL Studio 'native' plugin format. See the section on <a href="basics_externalplugins.htm">installing VST plugins</a> for more details on VST plugins and how to use them.
  <ul>

<li><b>Manage plugins</b> - We recommend '<b>Start scan ' (with 'Verify plugins' ticked)</b> to perform a complete scan that categorizes plugins as generators (instruments) or effects. FL Studio will add scanned plugins to the pop-up lists that appear when you use the <a href="channelrack.htm#channelrack_optionsmenu">Channel Rack > Menu > Add one</a> option,  <a href="channelrack.htm#channelrack_addchannels">Channel Rack + button</a>, <a href="menu_add.htm">Main menu > Add</a> option and <a href="browser.htm#Browser_PluginDatabase">Plugin database</a>. 
  
 <p class="justImages"><img src="img_shot/plugin_manager.png" width=""></p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> To perform a <b>fast scan</b> that simply lists installed plugins, deselect 'Scan and verify'. This is equivalent to the 'Browser > <a href="browser.htm#Browser_PluginDatabase">Plugin database</a> (right-click) > Refresh plugin list (fast scan)' option.
</ul>

<h4>Options Tab</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>Start scan</b> - Starts the scan process. Amazing fact!
  <ul>

  <li><b>Verify plugins</b> - Opens each plugin, categorizes it as a synthesizer or effect, reports if it is a 32 or 64 Bit plugin and lists the input/output ports. It's much slower than when 'Verify plugins' is off (which is the same as the Browser 'Refresh plugin (fast scan)') so be patient. If you see some pop-ups from plugins when scanning, you will need to respond and click them away to continue the scan. <b>Scanning with this mode is important</b> as it will correctly classify plugins as effects and generators.

  </ul>

  <li><b>Favorites</b> - Check the <b>F</b> (Favorite) column box for any plugin you want to add as a favorite. Selected plugins will show in 'add plugin' menu locations including: <a href="channelrack.htm#channelrack_optionsmenu">Channel Rack > Menu > Add one</a> option,  <a href="channelrack.htm#channelrack_addchannels">Channel Rack + button</a>, <a href="menu_add.htm">Main menu > Add</a> option and <a href="browser.htm#Browser_PluginDatabase">Plugin database</a> (without thumbnail). 

  <li><b>Plugin search paths</b> - Formerly called <b>VST extra search folders</b>, sets the default VST search locations.  You can add <b>extra search paths</b> to custom locations of VST plugins (to add more than one additional folder:

<ul>

<li><b>Add path</b> - Click and browse to the folder you want to add. Then click OK. This path will be added to future scans. You can add as many extra search locations as needed. <b>NOTE:</b> The folders set here do not appear in the Browser only the plugins found in those locations (see the <a href="browser.htm#Browser_PluginDatabase">Plugin database</a>). 
<li><b>Remove path</b> - Click on the path in the list above to select one, then click '<b>Remove path</b>'. <b>NOTE:</b> It's not possible to remove the default paths, only those you have added yourself.

</ul>  
<li><b>Rescan previously verified plugins</b> - Re-verify plugins that have previously been verified, in case something has changed. Leave this off if you want to scan for new plugins and not change previous results. This has no effect unless the option 'Verify plugins' is also selected.

  <li><b>Rescan plugins with errors</b> - Rescan plugins that showed an error during a previous scan. This will also apply to 'Fast scan'.

  <li><b>Combine 32 and 64 bit versions of a plugin</b> - Create a single preset for a plugin that has both a 32 Bit and a 64 Bit version. FL will use the '<a href="plugins/wrapper.htm#wrapper_pluginsettings">Bit size</a>' option on the Wrapper to determine which version to open.

   <ul>

   <li><b>Combine presets for VST and VST3 versions of a plugin</b> - When selected this also merges presets for (some) plugins that have both a VST2 and a VST3 version. FL will first try to load the VST3 version.

   </ul>

   <li><b>Try to prevent popup windows</b> - This suppresses some pop-up windows that show during a 'Verify plugins' scan, but not all. It may not work well with some plugins, so it's off by default. For example, when it is ON, you may get plugin errors that are due to pop-ups with settings that were not responded to, since they were hidden.

   </ul>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h4>Plugin Tab</h4>
<p>The Plugins tab provides options to change the data stored in the <a href="browser.htm#Browser_PluginDatabase">plugin database</a>, the data that is collected during plugin scans. Normally you do not need to edit this information. 

 <p class="justImages"><img src="img_shot/plugin_manager_plugin.png" width=""></p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Name</b> - Edit to change the plugin name shown in the database. 
  <li><b>Status</b> - <b>OK</b> or <b>Error</b> depending on the success of the last scan.
  <li><b>Type</b> - <b>Synth</b> or <b>Effect</b>. Decides where the plugin can be loaded in FL Studio. Use when a '<b>Refresh plugin list (fast scan)</b>' has been used and the plugin was not classified OR a plugin fails to scan correctly but is working as expected. Type can't be changed when the classification was set by a '<b>Verify plugins</b>' scan. 
  <li><b>Vendor</b> - The company that made the plugin.
  <li><b>Favorite</b> - Flags the plugin as a Favorite so it will show in the favorites lists. 
  <ul>
   <li><b>Category</b> - Change the Plugin Database category for the plugin. <b>NOTE:</b> The location of the plugin database is the FL Studio install folder - '<b>..\Data\Patches\Plugin database\</b>'. You can easily create new sub-folders, move and edit files with the system Browser.
  </ul>
  <li><b>Combined plugins</b> - Shows the plugins (VST 2 and 3, 32 Bit and 64 Bit) that are saved as a single preset when '<b>Combine presets for identical plugins</b>' was used (see above).
</ul>

<h3>Browser extra search folders (add your own folders to the Browser)</h3>
  <p>30+ custom Browser folders can be set (note the scroll-bar down the right side of the window).
  <p><b>How to set a Browser extra search folder:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Left-click on the folder icon at the start of a row as indicated above and browse to the folder location and then click 'OK'. Alternatively, double-click the text fields to enter paths manually.
    <li>Optionally, Left-click in the <b>Name</b> column and enter a custom name, this sets the name shown in the Browser. If the name field is left blank then the name of the target folder will be shown in the Browser.
    <li><b>OR drag-and-drop folders</b> - From any Windows file explorer onto the Browser. This will set a custom folder to match.
  </ol>
  <p><b>What do they do?</b> The folders set here will appear in the FL Studio  <a href="browser.htm">Browser</a>. Here are four good reasons to use them:
  <ol>
    <li>You can drag sounds/samples/patches from the Browser onto the desired location in FL Studio and they will be loaded automatically (channel sampler, slicer, projects [drag onto the desktop], etc).
    <li>External folders keep your data independent from the FL Studio installation. 
    <li>The extra search folders are (as the name suggests) included in automatic search and load operations.
    <li>The Browser contains some useful manual <a href="browser.htm#Browser_Search">search functions</a> ('Find' and 'Smart find') so you can quickly locate your files.
  </ol>

<p><a id="shareddata"></a>
<h3>Shared Data</h3>

<p>This folder is where Image-Line plugins will save and search for library content. For example DirectWave sample libraries  or Harmor preset libraries.

<p><a id="external_tools"></a>
<h3>External Tools</h3>

  <p>The External Tools dialog lets you set up external applications (wave editors, sample browsers, etc.) for use as tools in FL Studio.

    <li><b>File</b> - Enter the full path to the external application to be used as a tool. Alternatively, click the file icon on the left to browse to an application.

    <li><b>Name</b> - The program name displayed in the <a href="menu_tools.htm">Tools menu</a>. Click to edit.

    <li><b>Options</b> - Select the tool in the file list then choose options:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Launch with path</b> - Launch the selected tool when the path is accessed from within FL Studio. Useful for batch audio processing applications and external sample browsers.

        <li><b>Launch with file</b> - Set an external tool to be used with audio files. For example an Audio Editor. 
        <ul>
             <li><b>Default Editor</b> - Anywhere you see the menu option: '<b>Open in audio editor</b>', the tool set here will replace <a href="plugins/Edison.htm">Edison</a> (the default Editor).
        </ul>
        <li><b>Launch at startup</b> - Launches the program at FL Studio startup, useful for VDJ tools, DMX controllers or MIDI loop-back devices. Any external application you may be using with FL Studio on a frequent basis. 
      </ul>
  </ol>
