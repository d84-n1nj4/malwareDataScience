				<h3>Who can join band?</h3>
		<div class="answer"> <p>Children in Years 3-6 are eligible for our band programs, and children in Years K-6 are eligible for our string ensembles.</p>
</div>
				<h3>Why do I have to give 3 instrument preferences when signing up for band?</h3>
		<div class="answer"> <p>It is very important for us to achieve a balanced sound when setting up our bands. We aim to give you your first instrument choice but to maintain a balanced sounding band, we need as many options as possible, so we ask for three (3). A balanced sounding band will enhance your child’s overall band experience.</p>
</div>
				<h3>Thinking of pulling out of band?</h3>
		<div class="answer"> <p>Sometimes band is not for everyone. If your child does not want to continue, please send us an email to <a href="mailto:info@musicpartnership.com.au">info@musicpartnership.com.au</a> or alternatively, you can submit our online <a href="http://musicpartnership.com.au/band-program-music-lesson-renewcancel-enrolment-form/">Renew/Cancel Enrolment Form</a>.

		<div class="answer"> <p>Band fees are additional to your private lesson fees. You will receive an invoice for both at the beginning of each term.

Days and times vary according to each school. Please select your school from the drop-down menu <a title="Band Programs" href="http://musicpartnership.com.au/band-programs/">here</a> to find out exactly when lessons operate at your school.</p>

<p>Our specialist Music Partnership conductors are reliable, punctual and professional, and can cater for any students learning needs and musical experience.

<h2>Instruments</h2>
<div id="accordion-instruments">
				<h3 class="question">How do I know which instrument to choose?</h3>
		<div class="answer"><p>Choosing your instrument can feel like a big decision. Try looking at pictures online and listening to YouTube clips of people playing instruments. This will help give your child a better idea of each instrument and help them make a choice. Please visit our <a title="Instruments" href="http://musicpartnership.com.au/instruments/">Instruments</a> page for more detailed information about your instrument options.</p>
</div>
				<h3 class="question">How do I obtain an instrument for my child?</h3>
		<div class="answer"><p>You will need to hire or purchase your own instrument. The Music Partnership does not provide an instrument for you, but we are happy to assist you in hiring an instrument. We recommend <a href="http://musicpartnership.com.au/instruments/presto-instruments/">Presto Instruments</a>. Please email <a href="mailto:sales@prestoinstruments.com.au" target="_blank">sales@prestoinstruments.com.au</a> for all rental enquiries.</p>
</div>
				<h3 class="question">Are certain instruments easier to learn than others?</h3>
		<div class="answer"><p>All instruments have their challenges. The best way to get off to a great start is to practice at home every day! 10-15 minutes of regular practice each day is our advice.</p>
</div>
				<h3 class="question">Should I hire or purchase my instrument?</h3>
		<div class="answer"><p>Hiring is usually the best way to go for the first 3-6 months. We recommend <a href="http://musicpartnership.com.au/instruments/presto-instruments/">Presto Instruments </a>for instrument hire. Once your child has decided to commit fully to learning an instrument, we recommend that you purchase your own quality instrument.</p>
</div>
				<h3 class="question">How long does it take to become proficient at playing an instrument?</h3>
		<div class="answer"><p>This is a hard question to answer! Your child’s progress is really up to them. Practice practice practice! Usually within the first few months of learning and practicing, your child should be able to make a good sound and play a basic scale. Then the sky&#8217;s the limit! Mastering an instrument is something we can spend a lifetime achieving.</p>
