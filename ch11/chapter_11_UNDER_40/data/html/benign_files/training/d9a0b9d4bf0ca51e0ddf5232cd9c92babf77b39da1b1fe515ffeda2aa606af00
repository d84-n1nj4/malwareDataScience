Affirmative action programs are created in an attempt to make sure that all groups within a given society have the same opportunity to succeed. The term "affirmative action" was coined by President John F. Kennedy and expanded by President Lyndon Johnson. Although different terms are used for affirmative action in different nations, the concept is the same; affirmative action means making sure that active steps are taken so that minority groups are represented and hired in organizations, government and businesses. Employment decisions, admission to educational institutions, public health policies and other arenas have all been affected by a commitment to affirmative action. 
Instituting an affirmative action policy comes from a particular assessment of a nation's past; it is seen as necessary as a compensatory measure in cultures that have a history of discrimination or of withholding economic opportunities based on race or national origin. While some countries refuse to participate in affirmative action because they have so-called "color-blind" laws mandating that all races simply be treated equally, other countries feel that favoring previously oppressed groups, often called "reverse discrimination," at least for a period of time, is the only way to restore complete equality in the long term. This belief can lead to the adoption of hiring quotas in which a certain number of hires or appointments must come from previously under-represented groups of people. In the United States, affirmative action has been widely practiced, but nearly as widely critiqued. <br/><br/>adasdasdasdas

Women on average work 42min less a day than men which would be a big factor in the 'wage gap'. The only gap that exists is an earnings gap, and because women on average work less hours, take more time off, and work worse jobs, they earn less over a year.

Dogs or kittens? Kitties are better, Kitties are NOT lazy bums. They just don't care. They show their love in other ways. Dogs are gross and smell bad. No matter how much you wash a doggo, the doggo always has a smell. Also, they're greasy. Kitties are small and cat attacks generally don't put people in hospitals. They also don't drool everywhere like doggos do. [url]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.christmassongs&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk[/url]<br/><br/>
