<H3>Student Academic Integrity</H3>
<p>"By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities 
of an active participant in UMBC's scholarly community in which everyone's 
academic work and behavior are to be held to the highest standards of 
honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit 
these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic 
misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not 
limited to, suspension or dismissal. To read the full Student Academic Policy,
consult the UMBC Student Handbook, the Faculty Handbook, or the UMBC 
Policies section of the UMBC Directory." <p>
