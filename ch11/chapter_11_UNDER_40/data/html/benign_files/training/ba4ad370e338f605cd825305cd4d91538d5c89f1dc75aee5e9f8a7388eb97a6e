<h1><b>LV-426 - Colony Physical Overview</b></h1>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Last update 1st May 2004</font></b></p>
<p>Here's an overview of what I can figure out about the colony's structure. I'll 
  arrange it in a more coherent manner at some point. Maps, photos and schematics 
  are to follow. I have based it only on the Alien/Aliens movies. Where there 
  is some point from the comics (<font color="#990099">Newt's Tale - herein in 
  purple</font>) I have noted it. If there is any comment about the place in A3/A4 
  I have ignored it. There are some discrepancies between various sources as to 
  the layout of the colony, I'll try and note those as I go. The Tech Manual plan 
  is utterly different to the movie, and is ignored. However, it does give some 
  useful dimensions for the standard components, so I use those. I have attached 
  a few small images linked from the text to explain how I derived at certain 
  ideas. They all open in a <font color="#FF0000">NEW</font> window so you can 
  read and look at the picture. I did this rather than embed the images and cause 
  alot of unnecessary downloading of images just to get to the text.</p>
<h2>An Introductory Essay on the Social Side of LV426.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Civilian Aspects</h3>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The colony (Hadley's Hope - owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corp) supports 60-70 
  &quot;families,&quot; (as mentioned after Ripley's explanation to the 'Board' 
  of the Nostromo affair - <i>&quot;How many are there, how many colonists?&quot; 
  - &quot;I don't know, maybe 60, 70 familes&quot;</i>) equating to a population 
  of 158 (shown on the 'Welcome to' sign during the fly over scene.) Considering 
  several children are shown in the movie, one must assume some of the families 
  are either single people (I think unlikely they would send singles out to a 
  rough colony all alone in the wilderness with limited options of finding 'company') 
  or that the initial sign is now outdated, and the children are above the 158 
  total. In fact, after 20 years, if it's the initial sign, the number could be 
  vastly incorrect, though I can't see why the colony would get too much bigger 
  unless the operation was expanding. </p>
<p>The colony was created to oversee the terraforming of the moon, an automated 
  process likely to take several generations to achieve its goal (movie quote 
  - <i>&quot;takes decades, it's what we call a shake and bake colony&quot;</i>). 
  The moon has a good enough basis for future claims to invest in terra forming, 
  having abundant suitable metals, a strategic location, and abundant water making 
  terraforming a shorter or easier process. Within the period of terraforming 
  (colonies existence over 20 years) the atmosphere was made breathable, so likely 
  a suitable atmosphere was a prime factor in the planets choice. While the colonists 
  can walk outside, the general climate appears very hostile with high winds and 
  some free moisture. Therefore, most time is spent indoors.</p>
<p>It is clear that the station is periodically restocked from offworld, as there 
  is no hope of growing their own food, or mining for metals at this point. One 
  assumes this might be a 3 or 6 monthly occurence. In all other functions, the 
  colony needs to be self sufficient, so luxuries are likely to be scarce on the 
  ground. No doubt the colonists recieve good pay, but the transportation cost 
  for goods will probably negate alot of this. (<font color="#990099">Note: that 
  the comic 'Newt's Tale' does mention livestock being cocooned in the atmosphere 
  processor</font>)</p>
<p>While it is assumed most of the citizens are engaged in the terraforming operations, 
  the fact that at least one family is referred to as wildcatters and assumed 
  to be not so well off seems to indicate that there are others who rove outside 
  the colony on occasion for extra income. These may be geologists or rock hounds 
  (the seismic/mining charges mentioned in the movie). It seems they are outside 
  of the normal operations, but not outside the colony, so we can assume they 
  live within the colony complex, as they are seen driving out of the north west 
  gate. The general tone appears to be that there is a group of colonists outside 
  of the terraforming process, and may be 'lower' class workers, perhaps cleaners, 
  cooks, general repair workers, labourers or something similar who are keen to 
  look for abit of extra cash. Perhaps they work as part of the unloading crews 
  for the resupplies and are involved with steel fabrication. They may even live 
  in a separate part of the complex to the rest of the colony residents.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Miltary Aspects</h3>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The colony appears to have little military association with its operations. 
  The marine scout of the colony only mentions small arms hits and some seismic 
  charge blasts. Bullet marks in the walls tend to indicate some machine gun fire. 
  I assume the colony is not particularly heavily armed. There appears to be no 
  permament military defence infrastruture (ie gun towers, turrets, wall firing 
  ports, vehicles) so in essence the outlook for the colony is almost purely civilian. 
  There being no indigenous life forms, there would be little need for weapons 
  except against invasion (unlikely from another Corporation until the terra forming 
  is more completed I think), piracy (probably the more likely risk), or internal 
  dissention. </p>
<p>Weapons within the colony are likely to be strictly controlled, the only personal 
  weapons that might be allowed would be pistols I reckon. Clearly the wildcatters 
  did not take a weapon with them when they explored the derelict ship. They were 
  either stupid, inexperienced or had no weapons to take anyway. I assume weapons 
  are stored in one place under lock and key. I am uncertain whether there is 
  a security officer as such. I assume it's another duty for a senior manager.Weapons 
  for the colony are *likely* to be pistols, rifles (non military - not pulse 
  rifles) and shotguns. Small arms fire tends to indicate some light calibre MG, 
  most likely hand held. I find it unlikely there are enough weapons for each 
  colonist (<font color="#990099">certainly Newt's Tale indicates this. It indicates 
  a mix of shotguns - the main weapons - and pistols, and not many at that</font>) 
  Taking a punt I put weaponry at 4 SMG's, 16 shotguns, and 20 pistols. I would 
  say you have two options for how much the colonists can use the weapons. Only 
  a limited number would be trained to use the SMG's in either option. You either 
  have the option of allowing all colonists having a basic weapon training prior 
  to being sent to the colony, or only a select number being trained. Most of 
  them in either case won't be all that flash with weapons, as I couldn't imagine 
  them doing alot of weapons training on the colony. There might be one or two 
  who fill in time with gunnery practice, but not the whole 150! Conversely, they 
  been there 10 years, so maybe they do a firing range once per year to keep their 
  'licences' active.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the marines don't appear to find any of the 
  colonists weapons for their own use, considering that the command centre was 
  the location of the colonists last stand, and the place where any weapons would 
  be dropped. </p>
<h2>Gaming Hooks from the Essay</h2>
<p>A period of some 57 years elapsed between the Nostromo adventure compared to 
  the Sulacco adventure. </p>
<ol>
  <li>At some point between these two the planet was scouted for terraforming, 
    without the presence of the derelict alien ship being found. Either the beacon 
    had stopped working, or there never was a beacon and the Nostromo encounter 
    was the last in a series of encounters sent to a pre known problem area to 
    try and get some result beneficial to the Weyland-Yutani. This gives an opportunity 
    for a complete replaying of the Nostromo adventure with a whole new crew of 
    surveyors and ship. The only question will be what the synthetic knows! </li>
  <li>Over ten years prior to the Sulacco adventure, the colony site needs to 
    be scouted and constructed. This gives an opportunity for the playing of an 
    infestation outbreak and control. This can be complicated by large numbers 
    of workers (or small numbers if you think it's all very modular and prefabricated 
    off world) with possibly a small private mercenary contingent as guard during 
    the process.</li>
  <li>The Nostromo wasn't the last ship sent to the derelict Alien ship. This 
    time whichever group locates the Alien ship also finds another human ship 
    there, complete with it's own dormant Alien colony inside. Let ye olde gaming 
    begin. The Alien colony won't be that big, say a Queen and a dozen or so lackeys.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The LV-426 Complex</h2>
<p>Some of this physical description is quite wordy without apparently explaining 
  alot. I'm writing it out this way so that I can remember the pieces as I go 
  about recreating the plans. The ground level is called level 1.</p>
<p>The colony is constructed on a moderately open flat area nestled apparently 
  between some adjoining higher rock formations to the east and west, though the 
  atmosphere processor is in the open and not surrounded. The colony is most likely 
  constructed on the flat for easy of construction, and between the rock formations 
  for some weather protection. Within the flat there are still projections of 
  highly eroded rock formations, like the stuff the marines hid behind when the 
  dropship crashed. Judging by photos and the movie, an area roughly 30m outside 
  of the structures has been levelled and is either paved (concrete/steel near 
  entry ways) or natural (packed) soil. There is a 4m high solid metal 'fence' 
  across the north and north-west end of the colony, with a gate on the north-west. 
  It is not clear if this is repeated to the south, but it can be seen in the 
  closeup photo of the command centre..</p>
<p>The complex layout is shown several times in the movie, but never very well. 
  All dropship flyover sequences are very murky, and not easy to put together. 
  The scene where Hicks shows Ripley how to use the pulse rifle has a display 
  panel behind them showing the complex. Most of the time the north end of the 
  map is not visible. The map is shown again briefly just before they all rush 
  out to rescue Ripley from the fire alert. Lastly, there are a number of localised 
  photos on the cd extras disk. This also includes a complex layout made up of 
  <a href="lv426/woodlayout.jpg" target="new">wooden blocks</a>. This looks pretty 
  close to the final layout, but the angle the picture is taken at doesn't show 
  the southern end well at all. There is also some layout screens shown on the 
  light table they work on, which zooms in and out when they are looking for the 
  colonists. The <a href="lv426/lighttablecolony.jpg" target="new">colony layout 
  on this</a> (shown when Ripley talks about the service tunnel the Aliens are 
  using to access the complex) is not exactly the same as other layouts, and I 
  assume it is nothing more than a footprint layout for the concrete base which 
  is larger than the structures it supports. It at least clearly shows one access 
  tunnel only. </p>
<p>The complex itself consists of three main structure groups. The 'east' colony, 
  the 'west' colony and the atmosphere processing station (APS for this document). 
  The colony complex is constructed on a roughly north/south access, with the 
  APS to the south. The fly over sequences show a number of what appear to be 
  communications towers around the complex. These may be attached to the two landing 
  pads.</p>
<h3>East Colony</h3>
<p>The east core colony structure is mostly modular, and consists of linking corridors 
  on the east/west sides which are 2 storey and hexagonal in cross section. Between 
  these are the main 'rooms' which are trapezoid in cross section.Attached to 
  these standard pieces are a few specialists rooms, such as the command room 
  on the south side. Construction materials are steel for the main structure, 
  with a concrete base. A series of major cable trays run across the roof of the 
  structure and link it to the west colony. An <a href="lv426/accesscorridor.jpg" target="new">undergound 
  corridor</a> (service tunnel) connects it to the APS to the south. The underground 
  tunnel is constructed of concrete walls with steel doors and fittings and carries 
  all the cabling linking the two structures. It is not all that large, and could 
  barely comfortably accomodate two people walking abreast. It is secured at each 
  end by a pressure door and airlock. The structure has at least two sub levels, 
  seen when Hudson spits into one of the holes made by the death of one of Ripley's 
  'bad guys.' The second sub levels may instead be sub corridors carrying cable 
  trays, pipework and ducting underneath the structure. It may also be the main 
  drains, full of water usually (3' deep). This is the bit where Newt was taken 
  by the Aliens. They then subsequently probably returned her to the APS via the 
  underground corridor. <font color="#990099">Newt's tale indicates at least one 
  sub floor, though this may only be one particular store room.</font></p>
<p>There are three major air locks to the colony. North, south and east. </p>
<p>Level 2 of the complex contains the dedicated work areas (<i>&quot;Hey, you 
  know you kids aren't supposed to be on this level.&quot;</i>) This includes 
  the <a href="lv426/medbay.jpg" target="new">command centre and med labs</a> 
  (med bay to fore, command behind). The command centre has a higher ceiling than 
  the rest of the complex, as show on the <a href="lv426/commandexterior.jpg" target="new">exterior 
  view</a>, and also has an airlock below it. It appears all access between levels 
  is by stairs. All internal <a href="lv426/corridor.jpg" target="new">corridors</a> 
  in the complex are 9.1m wide due to their being half hexagonal, the actual walking 
  area is roughly only the 3m centre strip of the 9.1m width at the floor level. 
  Checking all views I have of corridors, they are all the same shape. There are 
  no square walled corridors. Upstairs and down stairs corridors all appear the 
  same shape as well.</p>
<h3>West Colony</h3>
<p>The west colony appears to be the recreation area, including a casino and 'bar 
  and grill.' It consists of a number of unique structures attached to each other, 
  most being single storey with a few parts having a second storey. Access to 
  the outer colony appears to be normal open air access, walking from one structure 
  to the other. There does not appear to be an underground passage connecting 
  the two. There's not alot of info on the west colony as the marines don't go 
  there in the movie. </p>
<h3>APS</h3>
<p>The APS is a connundrum to reconstruct. An external photo shows it being semi 
  conical and solid walled. I can't imagine anywhere in it that a dropship could 
  fly into without considerable risk, but it flies in through the main entryway 
  through a <a href="lv426/APSdropship.jpg" target="new">tower opening</a> with 
  heaps of room to spare. The Tech Manual describes it as being 1.5km high, and 
  judging by the photos therefore roughly 3km diameter. I have some MAJOR issues 
  with this size compared to some of the photography and I will tentatively put 
  it at 1/10 the size quoted. I say main structure 300m diameter, 150m high to 
  the top of the main structure. There is an antennae above this. The <a href="lv426/APSplan.jpg" target="new">above 
  ground structure</a> is symmetrical, with 6 <a href="lv426/tower.jpg" target="new">major 
  towers</a> surrounding it. There appears to be a major intake near ground level 
  at each tower, with <a href="lv426/APSentry.jpg" target="new">one major entry</a> 
  on the west side facing away from the colony (red arrow is where the APC drives 
  up, the yellow arrow where the dropship flies through). Nearby this is the landing 
  pad where the initial dropship lands to wait for the marines to do their job. 
  This major entry is split into two entry ramps. One drives straight up the middle 
  (36m wide) and goes roughly horizontal, <a href="lv426/APSlock.jpg" target="new">ending 
  in an airlock</a>. The bright light above the lock can be seen in the previous 
  entry picture just where the centre ramp would enter the structure. </p>
<p>This entry is ground level 1. The airlock continues in for a long wide corridor, 
  before T'ing both sides. Half way along it, the marines jumped out and headed 
  off to a flight of stairs on a corridor to the right. Here the stairs went up 
  and down. They went down the stairs to sub level 3. Here they found the Alien 
  nest not far from the steps. They went in, and quickly found the Alien nursery, 
  with all the colonists. During the subsequent action, <a href="lv426/frost.jpg" target="new">Frost</a> 
  falls down a stair well, at least 3, and probably four levels down to the bottom. 
  This gives a total of 6 or 7 sub levels. Ripley following behind in the APC 
  does a right at the T and continues doing right hand turns until she hits the 
  Alien colony on sub level 3. This therefore is likely the extent of the corridor 
  as far as going down is concerned. Once the marines are in, she reverses, does 
  a hard right again, and is going up. Therefore, she must return the other way 
  up to the ground level, where she drives out the door. Note the door opens and 
  closes on the way in, but not the way out. Note the corridor is quite high going 
  down and up, probably equating to 2 levels in height all the way. There is at 
  least one set of internal elevators (2 together) which go from sub level 2 to 
  level 5. Ripley has to get out at sub level 2 and run down a flight of steps 
  to the Alien lair.</p>
<p>Either side of the centre access ramp a main ramp (37m wide each) runs up into 
  the area of bright light, where I assume alot of airflow is being sucked in, 
  and so not regularly used as an access. This upper area is a very broad (100m) 
  and high (173) hexagonal shaped intake going straight through to the centre 
  structure core. The core is a vast array of pipes and flumes surrounding a single 
  venting chamber. This central chamber is 91m in diameter with a 75m wide clear 
  zone between the core and the exterior walls. From this 75m wide clear zone 
  to the exterior walls is cram full of pipes and flues. This main entry way is 
  lvl 2 of the APS. Above it are 3 more genuine levels. I guess this because Ripleys 
  elevator stops at level 5. The Queen has no control over hers, so I assume it 
  just goes to the top by itself. No doubt there are a few scattered levels above 
  this, accessed by stairwells. I'd almost think another series of elevators exists 
  which go right to the top. There are a couple platforms that cross from the 
  outer wall to the inner core, but not many. For example, the platform where 
  Ripley drops off is quite wide and long and doesn't appear to go anywhere in 
  particular. There is at least one platform crossing from wall to core above 
  this, so more levels exist.</p>
<h3>Landing Pads</h3>
<p>There are two landing pads, one near the north west gate on the outside, the 
  other about 200m to the west of the APS. The view where Bishop is piloting in 
  the 2nd drop ship clearly shows the APS entry directly behind him. The first 
  dropship leaves the APC at the northern one, then flies off, and is parked on 
  the southern one I guess. The second drop ship lands near the APS. Both landing 
  pads are surrounded on 3 sides by a 4m high solid metal fence. Each has at least 
  one major automated communication tower and beacon next to it. The pad itself 
  is made of metal sheet.</p>
<h2>The Colonists Last Stand</h2>
<p><font color="#990099">Newt's Tale very briefly describes the colony's last 
  stand, but not very well. It actually shows a few colonists being killed, which 
  in some ways surprises me. </font>How many marines in Aliens died by an Aliens 
  hands? We see the dropship pilot only actually killed IIRC. How many colonists 
  were killed? The marines found no dead bodies, and all colonist's personal data 
  transmitters were in the Alien lair.</p>
<p><font color="#990099">Newt's tale says that Mr Jorden is brought in with a 
  face hugger, and is followed shortly by a few others at least. Next cut scene 
  after a chestburster scene and the family is being moved to a safer place (sub 
  level storage) with many other unarmed colonists. They are told the marines 
  are coming (contradicting the movie story) At the same time the colonists send 
  a foray into the APS to hunt the Aliens and find out what they are doing, with 
  the action supervised from the command centre. The search party are armed with 
  shotguns and pistols, and locate the missing colonists, but are promptly over 
  run. Everyone flees to the safe area, which is sealed up, but in a scene reminiscent 
  of Starship Troopers, the door is unsealed because they believe there are people 
  trapped outside. The Aliens flock in and the few defenders are overrun. I count 
  at least 5 killed intentionally by the Aliens. Only Newt escapes in the ventilation 
  ducts.</font></p>
<p>Trying to work from the movie, information is scant and there needs to be some 
  reading between the lines and best guesses. We know it takes some time for the 
  wildcatters to reach the derelict ship. (<i>&quot;Al, hey Al!&quot; - &quot;What?&quot; 
  - &quot;Remember you sent some wildcatters out into the middle of nowhere last 
  week, out past the Alien Range.&quot; - &quot;Yeah, what?&quot; - &quot;One 
  of them's on the horn. A mom and pop survey team. Says he's onto something, 
  wants to know if his claim will be honoured.&quot;</i>) As the colony has been 
  there twenty years, it must be quite some distance through difficult terrain. 
  None of the colony vehicles appear to be overly fast, though the tech manual 
  says the Dohatai tractor has a top speed of 110km/hr over roads, and it just 
  as good over terrain. The colony commander has had enough time to pass since 
  ordering them out that he has basically forgotten them. That to me seems to 
  be 4 to 7 days travel, though they do have to go to the other side of the Alien 
  Range. It is possible they are doing other work on the way, so they may be from 
  2-7 days travel away in direct drive from the colony and could be driving 12 
  hour days at least. That's a long long way. My guess is that the derelict spaceship 
  is at least some 1000km away, though the distance isn't really all that important 
  compared to the time travelled. </p>
<p>What is unclear is the repercussions of the mayday call. It is apparent she 
  is calling for help (duh) but in truth why! A long distance away from base, 
  and a facehugger doing its job, a mayday call isn't going to achieve any real 
  result for quite some time. We see no evidence of air vehicles at the colony, 
  but considering the time delay we know it takes for a facehugger to drop off, 
  a 4-7 day drive back will be too long before the chestburster arrives. The Aliens 
  RPG says it takes give or take a few hours off 3 full days from attack to chestburster. 
  Note also the Aliens RPG says that one egg will be implanted for roughly every 
  30lb of flesh in the host. They are therefore implying an adult male could host 
  3-4 chestbursters no problems. I don't go along with this theory, and will stick 
  to one chestburster per hugger. General consensus among other sites is that 
  Queen Facehuggers are required to make Queens, and that warrior Aliens can lay 
  one egg give or take per day. Sounds rubbish to me, I prefer all huggers can 
  make viable Queens, and are only suppressed to warrior drone form by an exisiting 
  Queen's pheromone control. I'd suggest the immature form of the Queen looks 
  alot like a drone until it goes into a 3rd moulting phase to make the final 
  Queen shape.</p>
<p>We face the first quandry, how does the Alien get back to the colony from the 
  derelict ship? </p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <h3>Option 1</h3>
  </li>
  <li>We assume there is some emergency response air vehicle. It is likely to 
    be a limited size vehicle, possibly a scout observation vehicle. It is hard 
    to conceive a geological research station without some air observation. I 
    assume there are no satellites to do this. This also assumes the atmosphere 
    is calm enough usually to take an aircraft. This would then allow the retrieval 
    to take place in a number of hours, bringing the Alien directly into the heart 
    of the colony. However, this places the Alien into the secure and theoretically 
    quarantined Med Lab with a day or two's observation of the facehugger before 
    it comes off. It would be pure luck it escapes before being killed. While 
    the colony has two landing pads, we see no evidence of air vehicles at either, 
    though we don't see them that well anyway. The rest of the Jorden's drive 
    back, or are air lifted and someone else drives the tractor back.</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <h3>Option 2</h3>
  </li>
  <li>The Jorden's start driving back, and 3 days into the trip the chestburster 
    arrives. It flees the vehicle, and hitches a ride for a day or so. It grabs 
    little Timmy and is lost in the wilderness while the tractor makes a run for 
    it back to base. The Alien follows as best it can after a meal and a moult, 
    or randomly strikes the right direction and finds the colony. I don't go with 
    this, as it would take it too long to reach the base, but is dependant on 
    the time it took to get to the derelict ship, and then how fast she drives 
    back, and whether she pushes herself to just keep on driving without sleep. 
    This option though does give the Alien a chance to infiltrate the colony and 
    grab a few colonists before things get too suspicious though. After all, the 
    colonists may believe the good lady has murdered her husband instead and kid 
    instead. Husband has big hole in chest, kid is missing, other kid is in a 
    state of shock. Woman is incoherent. Who'd believe the chestburster story, 
    unless she brought the facehugger back with her. Unlikely, she'd probably 
    chuck it first opportunity. Depending on timing, I like this option. 
    <h3>Option 3</h3>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The Jorden's attempt to drive back to base, but are met part way back by 
    a rescue/medical team driving out to meet them. Chestburster arrives to give 
    them all a good scare. It hitches a ride on the tractor back to the colony, 
    possibly munching on Timmy or someone else on the way back. Not sure I like 
    the idea of it munching on one of them if it takes few days to get back. That 
    would tend to indicate the colony is now aware something is out there and 
    the colonies defences are likely to be tighter straight away, though conversely 
    they aren't well armed. Then again, is it going to be smart enough to lay 
    dormant to allow the vehicle to get to a more permanent food supply. </li>
</ul>
<p>I like option 2 best, but am open to other ideas. Option 1 &amp; 3 leave the 
  colony already on a state of some alert. Granted, they are looking for something 
  smaller than they are expecting, and you could play it out as another Nostromo 
  adventure. In all options it is pretty clear to me that unless there is a major 
  air lift vehicle, the outbreak is the result of the one facehugger attack, there 
  just isn't enough time to get out to the derelict ship with an exploration party 
  and bring them back. I can't see anyone driving out to the derelict ship over 
  several days while the colony faces the solo alien. The only way multiple face 
  hugger attacks will occur is if a search party is airlifted in a short period 
  of time to the derelict ship and brought directly back into the base. </p>
<h3>Some Comments on the Aliens Movie</h3>
<p>The dropship puts the APC down outside the northern fence and they then rush 
  the northern airlock. The dropship is seen taking off after dropping the APC 
  off, but it flies off to land somewhere else, which looks like it might be another 
  landing zone. A second landing zone is shown when Bishop lands the second dropship. 
  Why drop the APC off outside the fence, then fly to the other end of the complex 
  and wait there? Odd. Also, after the aliens have chased them out of the complex, 
  the dropship is still sitting around casually unaware of anything untoward. 
  Somehow they have been off the communications.</p>
<p>The marines split into two sections and begin searching a level per section. 
  They don't appear to search the two sublevels at all, they just march casually 
  off to the command centre. They clearly only search the eastern complex, and 
  then only a part of it. They do not find any civilian bodies.</p>
<p>When in the Queen's chamber, Ripley deliberately upsets the Queen. The place 
  is going thermo very soon, why bother? It would then negate the Queen chasing 
  her, and the whole Sulacco episode. On the other hand, perhaps the enraged Queen 
  loses control over her minions who then are confused for long enough not to 
  follow Ripley. </p>
<h3>Early Aliens Movie Scripts</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.planetavp.com/amr/scripts/alien2t.rtf" target="new">Script 
  1</a> -1983 pre treatment (Links to AVP site)</p>
<p>This script by James Cameron indicates that when the Alien vessel is first 
  found the colonists explore it after the first attack on Russ Jorden. It indicates 
  a dozen searchers, and during their visit to the ship, alot of eggs open, giving 
  the impression that the floor is alive with huggers.</p>
<p>Script 2 - 1985 the first draft script parallels the movie, and does not give 
  any indication of further Alien activity on Acheron. </p>
