About Book</p>
<p>
Ten years ago, Larson Ireland&rsquo;s wife was brutally murdered, and ever since then he&rsquo;s been fighting to forget and numb his pain and anger.<br />
<br />
Tasha Mackenzie made the biggest mistake of her life at the age of seventeen. Six years later she&rsquo;s still trying to move on and start fresh. With parents that see her as a shameful sinner who disgraced them, the only thing that Tasha looks forward to is seeing Larson at the gym where she works.<br />
<br />
Larson doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s good enough to ever be with anyone again, especially not a sweet woman like Tasha. He knows the darkness he carries inside will only hurt everyone in the end. But he wants Tasha, sees a vulnerability and innocence in her, and he wants desperately to let himself love again. Can Larson let go of his past and embrace a future with Tasha? Does he even want to risk it?</p>
