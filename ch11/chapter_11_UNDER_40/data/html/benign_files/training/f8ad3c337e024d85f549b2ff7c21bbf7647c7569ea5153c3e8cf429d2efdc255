<p>The truth is that the average ruby anniversary or 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary gifts will be a bit costly, as ruby is a stone that costs a bit. However, if you can get creative, you will be amazed by all the fun ideas you can come up with!</p>
<p><b>The Ruby Wedding Anniversary</b></p>
<p>Ruby is the stone that is given out for the 40<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary gift, and it’s a very unique stone. Many people have thought that rubies burned with an eternal inner flame, and thus the red stone is perfect to signify the eternal nature of a marriage after 40 years. The truth is that anyone that has been married for 40 years is probably going to spend the rest of their lives together, as they have made it through everything that life can throw at them. Now that they’ve retired, they’re able to spend time living with and loving each other the way they were meant to.</p>
<p><b>40<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary Gift Ideas for Him</b></p>
<p>Coming up with stuff to get him on this wedding anniversary is no doubt going to be a challenge, especially if you want to keep the gifts under the umbrella of the traditional wedding gift: the ruby. Here are some ruby anniversary gifts that you can give him:</p>
<p><b>Ruby Trip –</b> If you want to take a vacation someplace for your 40<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary, you may find that there are a number of places that will still be acceptable as traditional wedding anniversary gifts on the ruby anniversary. For example, Ruby Valley in Nevada is one such place, as is the Ruby Golf Course – which is located in the Bahamas. You will find that giving him these ruby gifts will be perfect for him on this special day, and he will love the idea that you can both still travel together.</p>
<p><b>Ruby Wine Glasses –</b> No doubt as he has aged his tastes have changed from drinking a lot of beer to more mature tastes, such as wine and scotch. If you want to give him a gift that will have value, a set of ruby wine glasses will be a wonderful gift. These glasses will be fairly costly, but they will add value to his home bar setup. You will find that these glasses will be very delicate, so they’ll have to be saved for those special occasions when you have guests over. Regardless of when you use them, rest assured they’ll be very useful when he wants to show off to his friends.</p>
<p><b>Ruby Decanter and Carafe –</b> Ruby is a very delicate material, and you will find that there are a lot of decanters and carafes that are made out of this wonderful gemstone. They will be a bit costly, but what does that matter on this special day? One of the best 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary gift options for him will be these lovely and elegant bottles, where he will be able to leave his wine to aerate on those evenings when you two sit outside and share a glass of wine together. It’s a gift that will come in very handy, so it will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p><b>40 Year Old Movie </b>– When you first started going out more than 40 years ago, was there a movie that you both enjoyed immensely? If you want to get him a gift that he is guaranteed to love, why not dig up that old movie that you both loved, laughed at, and went to see at the theater together. You will find that there are many old movies on Amazon, Blockbuster, and other websites, or you can order the movie directly from the production company online. There are many old movies that you no doubt loved together, so getting him this gift will show him that you remember all the fun you two had when you were younger.</p>
<p><b>Ruby Port –</b> A nice bottle of ruby port can be perfect for your man that has a sweet tooth, as a bottle of the fairly sweet wine will be a wonderful present. You will find that it’s a liquor that you can enjoy too, even if you only drink a little bit. You will both enjoy the deliciously sweet flavor of the alcohol, and it will make a wonderful drink on those evenings that you share together. It’s a gift that he will definitely love, and it may actually go perfect with the meal that you’re sharing on this special day.</p>
<p><b>Ruby Ring –</b> Most men will prefer simple rings over fancy ones, but you may find that your man will appreciate a ruby ring on this special occasion. It can be a simple ring like a class ring, or it can be a fancier and more complex one. You can give his wedding band an upgrade and add the ruby onto it, or you can do the same with any of the other rings that he owns. It is a simple present that he may or may not like, but you should consider it if you want to do something special for him.</p>
<p><b>Painting –</b> A painting is something that most people won’t consider as a good anniversary present, but there are a number of paintings that will still be a good 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary gift. For example, the Norman Rockwell painting of Ruby Bridge is an excellent one, or a picture painted by Ruby the Elephant at the Phoenix Zoo. These paintings can be a wonderful present, and they can add a bit of color and life to your home. Your husband may not be an art man, but a nice painting is always appreciated.</p>
<p><b>40 Year Old Wine or Scotch – </b>If you want to give him a gift that he will definitely treasure, why not get him a costly bottle of something alcoholic? There’s nothing quite like a bottle of Scotch that has aged 40 years, or a bottle of wine that was harvested 40 years ago. It’s a present that he can be proud of, and he will show it off proudly to all of the friends that come over. When he finally does open it, you will be able to enjoy the simple happiness that it causes him. It’s a wonderful present, and worth every penny!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Gift Ideas for Her</b></p>
<p>Getting something for that special lady in your life is very important, even after 40 years of marriage. The 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary gift that you choose for her will be a very central part of the celebration that you share, so you need to get her a gift that she will like. Here are some ideas for you to try:</p>
<p><b>Pendant –</b> A ruby pendant is a wonderful gift that you can give her, and you will find that there are many different pendants that you can give her. The large red stone hanging in front of her will show her just how passionate you are for her, and how much the fire in your heart is still burning for her even after all of these years. It’s a wonderful present for her, and she’s sure to appreciate it. Make sure that you choose the right metal, though, as the stone will usually look better when set in white gold or silver. If she prefers yellow gold jewelry, however, the stone’s fire will not be as bright.</p>
<p><b>Earrings and Necklace Set –</b> There’s nothing like a set of jewelry to let her know just how much you love her, so why not consider getting her a pair of earrings with a necklace to match? It doesn’t have to be a huge pair of earrings with a large pendant necklace, but it will be a simple gift that will be nice and subtle. It is a beautiful present, though, and she will be able to wear it when she dresses up fancy to go out or for formal occasions. A good jewelry set will be useful for many occasions, so it can be a good idea of  a gift to get her!</p>
<p><b>40 Roses –</b> There’s nothing that shows your love more than a dozen roses, or is there…? You may want to consider getting her a bouquet containing 40 roses, especially if she is the kind of women that likes to receive flowers. As another cute gift, you can get her a gift of 40 different packets of flower seeds, with roses being the main seeds that you purchase. These flowers can be a wonderful present, and she may love the idea of being able to plant beautiful flowers in her garden.</p>
<p><b>40 Gifts –</b> If you really want to do something special for her, why not consider getting her a gift every day for the 40 days leading up to your wedding anniversary. It can be a bit expensive, but you will find that it will be a wonderful way to do something small every day. You can get her simple gifts, and the only thing that you will need to do is make sure that they are all red or incorporate red in some way. Other than that, you can get her a lot of little gifts that she will find cute, tasty, and romantic! It’s a very loving gesture that she is guaranteed to enjoy!</p>
<p><b>Ruby Lingerie –</b> No doubt you still find your wife absolutely ravishing even after all these years, so why not get her a little something sexy to slip into? Lingerie is just as beautiful on older women as it is on younger ones, and getting her an item of ruby red lingerie can be a gift that you will enjoy as much as she does. Obviously, you’re not able to perform the same sexual stunts that you could when you were younger, but you’re still in the game when it comes to bedroom acrobatics!</p>
<p><b>Ruby Vases –</b> If she is the kind of woman that likes to put fresh flowers on the table, a ruby vase is a wonderful present for her. Even if she uses artificial flowers, she will still enjoy the way the ruby vase will class up the dining room when you sit down for dinner. The ruby crystal is very delicate and fragile, but it’s very valuable. It will be a gift that will have a good deal of value, and it’s something that she will remember every time she goes to set fresh flowers at the table before dinner.</p>
<p><b>Ruby Glass –</b> There is a type of glass that comes out ruby red, and it’s made by adding gold to the glass making process. You’ll find that ruby glass can be quite costly, but it will be a wonderful gift that you can give her. Even if you just get her a simple bowl or a set of ruby glass plates, it will be a decorative item that will have a good deal of value.</p>
<p><b>Ruby Jewelry Box – </b>A jewelry box is something that most women need, especially after years of you giving her gifts of jewelry. If you want to give her a gift that’s both practical and beautiful, you will find that a ruby jewelry box is one of the best gifts for her. She’ll be able to keep all of her jewelry organized inside the beautiful box, and it will be an elegant addition to her accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These gift ideas are just the beginning, and you have creative license to come up with as many more gift ideas as you possibly can in order to make this day as special as possible!</p>
