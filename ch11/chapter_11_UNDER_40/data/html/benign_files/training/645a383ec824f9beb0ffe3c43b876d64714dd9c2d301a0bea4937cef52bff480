																					<h3>What is Cellulite</h3>
																					<p>Don't Cover it up. Reduce the Appearance of Cellulite Naturally with Dermology Cellulite Solution!
																					Dermology Cellulite Cream helps reduce the appearance of cellulite by attacking the problem where it
																					lives: just beneath your skin. The unsightly bumps of cellulite are the result of pockets of fat

																					<p>No more hiding under sweaters and jeans - with Dermology you can dust off that swimsuit and
																					 hit the beach with confidence thanks to these exciting features
																					 Cellulite is the bumps under your skin which cause the surface of your body to look dimpled.
																					 This is caused by little overfilled fat pockets right underneath your skin. These fat
																					 pockets become enlarged causing the cells to take up more space between the skin's
																					 connective tissues than normal; the fat then expands these spaces resulting in the
																					 overlying skin-dimpling appearance. Cellulite causes many image problems and many
																					 omen don't dare to wear short skirts or shorts because of it. Dermology will not
																					 make you lose weight, but it will smooth your skin to reduce the appearance of
																					 hese unsightly dimples. Take action and reduce the appearance of cellulite now!</p>

																				<h3>Why dermotology works</h3>
																				<p>Dermology is formulated to reduce the appearance of cellulite on your legs, stomach and arms with
																				all-natural ingredients easily absorbed by your skin combined into an easy-to-use topical rub that
																				is 100% safe. Applying those ingredients directly to problem areas with the Dermology Cream
																				Solution allows for their maximum effectiveness and the quickest results for you! </p>
																				<p>Perhaps the most important ingredient contained in the Dermology Anti-Cellulite Solution is caffeine.
																				Studies show that increased blood flow resulting from caffeine consumption helps reduce the
																				appearance of cellulite. However, drinking more coffee or diet soda will not give you the
																				same results as Dermology because the caffeine will never reach those cells that cause
																				cellulite with anywhere near the impact of the Dermology Topical Cellulite Rub being applied
																				directly to your problem areas.</p>
																				<p>Another important element of this cream is are the natural skin-enhancing ingredients included
																				to promote healthier looking skin. Unfortunately, cellulite does not necessarily go away if you
																				lose weight: </p>
																				<p>Many slim women suffer from the same cellulite problems as everyone else. In fact every woman
																				has a certain amount of cellulite, because this is the unfortunate way our bodies store fat
																				creating the unsightly dimpled appearance of cellulite. The natural formula will help improve
																				your skin's texture for a smoother and firmer look thus reducing the appearance of cellulite.</p>
