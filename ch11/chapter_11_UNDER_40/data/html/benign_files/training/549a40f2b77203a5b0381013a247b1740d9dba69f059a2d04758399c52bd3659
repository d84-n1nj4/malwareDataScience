          <p style="font-size: 13px">Long before the concept of Guilty Pleasures existed, there was only pleasure. Jess Upton &amp; The Guilty Pleasures want to take you to that place again.          The band members first met when rowing along the disco floor, line astern, to the strains of 'Oops Upside Your Head' in 1979. Later that same evening, they found themselves dancing around the same handbag. <br />
          That handbag belonged to Jess Upton: and thusly was an unbreakable bond formed.Let's hear it for Jess 'Lipgloss' Upton, Steve 'Starsky' Wilson, Sam 'Multicoloured Swap Shop' Ryall, Chris 'It's Frothy, Man' Page and Marco 'Rear Of The Year' Rossi.          </p>

          <p>Ever since the formation of the remarkable Jess Upton Soul Band –   when Jess was a mere 17 years old – she has captivated audiences the   length, breadth and depth of Britain, garlanded on each appearance with   sincere and glowing plaudits.

Determined to overcome his physical shortcomings – although the tail came in bloody useful on occasion – Marco took up the guitar, and in due course joined Island Records signings KMO: a fine ensemble who toured throughout Europe and the USA, supporting Rod Stewart, Sting, INXS, Status Quo and Simple Minds among a veritable host of others. “Did I ever tell you about the time I played Wembley?” Marco will often slur. Very often. The story is actually true, but it\’s best to indulge him: he\’ll go away after a while, after rifling your pockets for pfennigs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marco now plays with Gothic Chicken, Dorset\’s eighth-favourite band of psychedelic peons, and fronted Cheese in the mid-1990s with stalwart support from aforementioned chums Steve Wilson and Padge.&lt;/p&gt;')"/>
