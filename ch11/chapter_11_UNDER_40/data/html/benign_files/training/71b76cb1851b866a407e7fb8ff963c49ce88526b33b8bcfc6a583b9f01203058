<h1>Company Overview</h1>
<p>Founded in 1957 we serviced a small part of the local engineering industry. As we became established and demand increased we in turn gradually increased our range of products to a stage where now we stock arguably the widest range of circular hollow steel tubing and pipe in Australia. Somewhere in the vicinity of 600 stock lines.</p>
<p>Our aim is to be a &quot;one stop shop&quot; for circular steel tubing and pipes, stocking the standard sizes as well as a wide range of intermediate sizes unable to be serviced by other suppliers. We also cut to length many sizes. You don't necessarily have to buy a full length.</p>
<p>
  The end users in a variety of industries have accepted our products which are manufactured with strict quality control by only the most reputable steel mills in the world.<br />
  As a stockist and supplier we have always been very committed to quality and as we are not the manufacturers, our way of assuring best quality is to purchase from only the very best steel mills in the world, keep extremely strict quality control in store. Prior to supply, material must once again pass through two rigid inspection points.</p><p>
  All material is subject to manufacturer’s tolerances and cut lengths are subject to cutting tolerances. Mill inspection certificates are available on request at time of order.</p>
  <p>To our much valued customers, you have our pledge to, continue to deliver the best customer service you deserve.</p>
  <h2>Our pledges are...</h2>
  <h4><span>1.</span> Best Quality</h4>
  <h4><span>2.</span> Best Customer Service</h4>
  <h4><span>3.</span> Fast and Accurate Delivery</h4>
  <h4><span>4.</span> To endeavour to always have the stock when our regular customers require it.<img class="col1 img" src="images/inner-pic.gif" alt="steel pipes" /></h4>
