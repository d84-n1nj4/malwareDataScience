<h3>The undetectable CRYPTER - the one and only!</h3>
<div class="dots"></div>
<h4><span itemprop="name">BitCrypter</span> is a high-performance executable packer and protector for native <span itemprop="operatingSystem">Windows</span> 32-bit programs and .NET apps.</h4>
The <strong>Undetectable Crypter</strong> can encrypt and compress 32-bit executables and .NET apps without affecting their direct functionality. For instance, if you're a software developer, you can encrypt your applications before they are delivered to customers. By using our encryption and compression techniques your applications will be more protected and smaller. Also, the crypted applications will be undetected when scanned with some of the most used antivirus products. In the case your program gets detected by an antivirus (like Norton, AVG, Avast, McAfee, NOD32, Panda, TrendMicro), <strong>Cryptor</strong> will make it undetected. This is by far the best crypter available on the Internet. Be aware that the programs "crypted" with the trial version of our software could be detected, as the trial version is publicly available on our website.<br>
<h5>The native Windows programs packed by BitCrypter are compatible with Windows 2k, XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 (32-bit and 64-bit systems) and they won't need .Net Framework or other dependencies.</h5>
<h5>The .NET applications packed by BitCrypter will need the .NET Framework for running.</h5>
