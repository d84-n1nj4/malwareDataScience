<h2>Consumer Information</h2>

<h3>It’s Your Choice</h3>
<p>The installer aims to provide a comfortable and engaging experience for users</p>

<h3>What does the installer do?</h3>
<p>The installer manages the installation process of your software, from start to finish. Read our <a href="/262/PrivacyPolicy/365">Privacy Policy</a> to learn about what data we collect.</p>

<h3>Why is this software free?</h3>
<p>
    We are able to offer you free software because we are advertiser supported. When the installation runs, our advertisers has a chance to speak to all of you, making offers that you might like.
    All offers are optional, so you can always deselect them if you don't see anything you like. Choose "decline" or use the "custom" selection during the offer screen to choose which offers you
    are interested in. If you change your mind later, you can always uninstall. Remember, you are under no obligation to accept any offers.
</p>

<h3>How do I run the installer?</h3>
<p>Simply click the download button, and run the executable. It's as simple as that. If for some reason the download fails, please just try again.</p>

<h3>Our Advertising</h3>
<p>All our offers are optional, and there is absolutely no obligation to accept. We do everything we can to make sure you see ads that are relevant to your interests, and your PC's capabilities.
The offers you see are paired with the products being downloaded. We task each product to make sure it installs on your computer.</p>
