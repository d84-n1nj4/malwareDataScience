Pioneer African-American Businesswoman</small></big></big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal">By Margaret Robe Summitt</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big>Luella Ruth Brown Boyer, probably the first African-American
businesswoman in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Everett</st1:place></st1:city>,
arrived here about 1902 with her husband John C. Boyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after they arrived, their marriage broke
up, and Luella supported herself and her adopted daughter Esther Marie as a
hairdresser, styling herself &#8220;Madame Boyer,&#8221; and later established a salon in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Everett</st1:place></st1:city>&#8217;s theater
district.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luella Ruth Brown was born in either October 1868 or
September 1869 in Keosauqua, Van Buren County, Iowa, to Lewis and Elizabeth (<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Henderson</st1:place></st1:city>) Brown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her parents had come from <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Missouri</st1:place></st1:state> to Van Buren County in about
1864.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lewis Brown traced his family
lineage to the first 20 slaves brought to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Jamestown</st1:city>,
 <st1:state w:st="on">Virginia</st1:state></st1:place>, in 1619.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elizabeth Henderson Brown performed housework
for white families, including several lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her son Samuel Joe Brown, Luella&#8217;s younger brother (1875-1950), fulfilled
his mother&#8217;s dream that he would become a lawyer and went on to a distinguished
career as an attorney and civil rights leader. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Her mother&#8217;s dreams for her children likely also
inspired Luella.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parents, however,
were dead by about 1889.<span style="">&nbsp;<img style="width: 150px; height: 262px; float: right;" alt="Samuel Joe Brown, Lawyer" src="SamuelJoeBrown.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5"> </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More information is needed about Luella&#8217;s life between the
ages of 12 and 26; i.e., between her appearance in the 1880 Census and her first
marriage around 1896 to John C. Boyer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was 25 years younger than her first husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Born in 1844 to free blacks in Clinton
County, Pennsylvania, John C. Boyer moved westward with the frontier seeking business
opportunities as a barber, and likely networked with black barbers in the
East.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He worked in Dakota Territory and
in <st1:state w:st="on">Kansas</st1:state>, and possibly met Luella in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iowa</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By 1900 the couple, now married, was living
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Lewiston</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Idaho</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two years later they arrived in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Everett</st1:place></st1:city>.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the time they came to Everett, John and Luella Boyer
legally adopted baby Esther Marie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Polk&#8217;s 1902-03 Everett Directory lists John as a traveling
salesman--probably of hair care products&#8212;and Luella as the proprietress of a
ladies&#8217; hair emporium at 2928 Colby Ave.; this address was also their
residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this John C. Boyer disappears
from Polk&#8217;s Everett Directory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He turns
up again in the 1920 Census for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Seattle</st1:city></st1:place>;
nonetheless Luella, in the 1910 Census, maintained the polite fiction that she
was a widow.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a single mother in a new town, Luella, however, was not
without resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She must have turned
to John Boyer&#8217;s business connections, and to her own schooling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Polk&#8217;s Directory entries for the years
1902 through 1912 show how she established and expanded her business:</big></p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madame Boyer&#8217;s obituary indicates that she was well known in
the community, yet I suspect that she was following trends developing
elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to historian Tiffany
Gill, &#8220;Madame&#8221; was frequently adopted by black women hairdressers and came to
signify them almost exclusively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
most famous of these &#8220;Madames&#8221; was Madam C. J. Walker of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indianapolis</st1:place></st1:city>, who was developing her line of
hair care products at the same time that Madame Boyer was establishing her
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One might speculate that
Madame Boyer knew, or knew of, Madam C.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>J. Walker, and may even have sold her products.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luella also worked as a housekeeper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Everett Public Library has the receipts
that she signed, for $1.00 a night, for occasional backstage housekeeping at
the Everett Theatre at 2911 Colby, nearly across the street from her business
address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She may also have done
hairdressing backstage.<img style="width: 350px; height: 137px; float: right;" alt="Receipt for custodion services for Luella" src="Boyerreceipt.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5"></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A peak event in her life must have been the performance, on
January 16, 1905, of the first all African-American musical comedy, &#8220;In
Dahomey,&#8221; at the Everett Theatre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
touring company featured show business legends George Walker, his wife Aida
Overton Walker, and Bert Williams, song and dance comedians who had recently
entertained the King of England in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meeting them was a rare opportunity to
network and maybe inspired her to expand her business.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Just before she remarried, Luella Boyer was enumerated in
the 1910 Census.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was age 42, with
her own hairdressing parlor, and she employed a black maid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband-to-be, Bertrand Brent, who was
white, was born about 1878 in Missouri, and was working in 1910 as a waiter in
a restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1911 his occupation was
a janitor at the Everett Public Library.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were married just after the census was taken, on April 20, 1910, by
Father H. P. Saindon of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presumably Bertrand Brent was Catholic, but
Luella was not, and as a condition of their marriage she agreed to have her
daughter Esther raised Catholic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
about this time Esther began boarding at St. Dominic&#8217;s Academy, adjacent to the
church.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of her remarriage, Luella Boyer Brent was at her
most prosperous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may have been about
this time that she and her husband began buying property in Snohomish and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">King</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Counties</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of her death, they owned in
Pinehurst Lot 13, Block 14, and Lots 23 &amp; 24, Block 23; in the Climax Land
Co.&#8217;s Addition to Everett, Lots 24 &amp; 25 in Block 2, and in <st1:placename w:st="on">Interurban</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Heights</st1:placetype>
in <st1:placename w:st="on">King</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">County</st1:placetype>,
<st1:place w:st="on">Lot</st1:place> 13, Block 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the Pinehurst lost Luella paid $100 out
of her own funds out of a total of $143.95.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These were unimproved lots except for those in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Everett</st1:place></st1:city>, for which was paid $894.41, of which
the Brents recouped $500 paid by their insurance company for loss due to fire.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Luella Boyer Brent died December 18, 1912 from diabetes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon her death Bertrand Brent began the long
(1912-1918) and frustrating process of administering her estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luella&#8217;s only will, drawn in 1909, was
outdated; Mr. Brent therefore had Luella declared to have died intestate, and
petitioned to be named administrator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After he had paid all her creditors, and the attorneys and appraisers,
he declared to the court the necessity of selling Luella&#8217;s real property in
order to pay his costs and expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
none came forward to buy either the real property or the remaining salon
fixtures and hair goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, Mr.
Brent declared that since no sale had been made, the balance of the estate
should be distributed between the heirs, i.e., him and Esther.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 14, 1918, the estate was fully and
finally settled and closed.<img style="width: 350px; height: 181px; float: right;" alt="Gravestone of Luella Boyer Brent" src="10-28-10Cemetery0929Brent.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5"></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point Madame Boyer disappears from the public
records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am still looking for a photo
of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her former residences on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Hewitt Ave.</st1:address></st1:street> are now
lost to the complex of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Everett</st1:placename>

was located on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Colby Ave.</st1:address></st1:street>
there is today a nail salon.</big></p>
