We have covered a lot of ground in our orchestral series already; there’s the scary Tutti, the uplifting Vivace, the understated Minimal, the driving Grosso and the majestic Capriccio. We’ve always had a yearning to capture something more delicate, and now we’ve done it… presenting “Sotto”. As a composer there are certain musical rules that you have to obey, and one of them is that there always has to be contrast. A loud passage will not sound really loud unless it’s contrasted by a softer counterpart, and a climax cannot arrive without a journey to get you there.  We have always been fascinated by the sound of a majestic orchestra hitting the brake pedal and laying down soft beds and patterns, and that is what we’ve achieved with this library. Anyone who has ever attempted to capture a live orchestra will be able to tell you that very quiet playing is a tricky thing to record. The softer you try to go, the closer you get to the breakpoint between sound and no sound. The starts of phrases in brass and woodwinds become increasingly hard to align for the players, resulting in beautiful imperfection. The balance of sound to mechanical noise tips slightly in favour of the mechanical noise, but to us it all sounds very much alive. There are a lot of beautiful beds with different playing techniques, like sul tasto, sul ponticello and harmonics for strings, frullato for woods and different mutes for brass. For Sotto we further expanded our voice leading concept to get even smoother transitions between chords. The combinations of different phrases and sections sound absolutely stunning, with a very warm and rich timbre. We’re so excited to add this product to our range as it stands proud alone and also complements other Sonokinetic orchestral products.  To add intimacy we have included a breath slider for woodwinds and brass that will add ‘air’ to the phrases, further blurring the line between sound and no sound, and musical sound versus human sound. We really wanted this to be a living breathing instrument that can add life to your compositions and feel we have succeeded in doing just that. We hope you agree.\nWe, at Sonokinetic BV, are very proud to introduce Sotto to you and can’t wait to hear the amazing things you, our valued customer base, will produce with it. Sonokinetic has established a name as one of the best value \u0026 quality sample producers and with this product we’d like to underline that statement.
