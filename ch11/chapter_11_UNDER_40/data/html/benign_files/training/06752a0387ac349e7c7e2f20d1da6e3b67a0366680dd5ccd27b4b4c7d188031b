</a> : What exactly does a gear ratio mean?

<hr>
<h2>Q:<br>
What exactly does a gear ratio mean?
</h2><hr>
<p>In the context of the final drive ratio (rear end), it's the number of turns the driveshaft makes per turn of the axle.  So, on a 3.92:1 rear gear, the driveshaft will turn 3.92 times for every one revolution of the axle/wheels.</p>

<P>Going to a lower (numerically higher) gear will increase your RPMs at a given speed but improve your off the line performance.  A higher (numerically lower) gear will get you off the line slower but keep your RPMs lower at a given speed.</p>

<P>Changing your tires will also affect the "effecitve" gear ratio.  A taller tire will have the effect of going to a higher gear - this is why folks will go to 3.92s or even 4.10s when moving up to much larger tires than stock.  A lower gear counteracts the taller tires to a degree.</p>

<p>Easy way to remember: High number, high RPMs, high "kick".  Low number, low RPMs, low "kick".</p>
