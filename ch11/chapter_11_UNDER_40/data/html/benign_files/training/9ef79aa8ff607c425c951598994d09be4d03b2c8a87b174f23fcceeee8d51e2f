          <h1>Software Systems Engineering (SSE)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Silicon Valley is the epicenter of the software industry, and Carnegie Mellon University brings its expertise in software education and research to the eco-system. The Software Systems Engineering program (SSE) encompasses software systems technologies, software engineering methods, and management techniques that improve the quality and delivery of modern software intensive systems and applications.&#160;In a culture where products are shipped in weeks,&#160;we work quickly to find pragmatic solutions to challenges faced by industry. &#160;</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley climate of innovation and entrepreneurship has a strong influence on our research, resulting in an emphasis on projects that can be applied to real world problems rather than purely focusing on foundational research. Our location puts us in close proximity to many of the world's most innovative companies, and we have been able to draw on their top technical leaders to present their work in our weekly colloquia.</p>
<p><span>Our primary focus is on mobile, embedded, sensory, and cloud computing systems. The teaching and research programs in SSE reflect the unique character and software development style of Silicon Valley, making it an excellent home for students, faculty, and visitors who want to participate in our varied activities and connect with Silicon Valley. &#160;</span></p>

<h2><span>Graduate Programs</span></h2>
<p><span ></span>The professional&#160;<a href="../academics/index.html">master's programs</a>&#160;provide our students with useful knowledge that they can quickly apply. Classes are project-based and team-oriented. We follow a learning-by-doing model, supported by faculty coaching. In keeping with the campus theme of &#8220;Developing Software Leaders,&#8221; the programs place a high value on improving written and spoken communication skills as part of working on authentic deliverables.</p>

<h2>Unique Program Features</h2>
<p><strong>Distinctive Teaching Methodology.</strong> Carnegie Mellon faculty members use a wide variety of teaching methods to maximize students&#8217; learning experiences, including discussion sessions, small group coaching, problem-driven seminars, individual and &#8220;just-in-time&#8221; instruction in the form of online materials, learning guides, and short tutorials.</p>
<p><strong>Project-Based Curriculum.</strong> The program features a heavy reliance on learn-by-doing projects, case analyses, and industrial practicums so that coursework is immediately applicable to responsibilities at work.</p>
<p><strong>Team Orientation.</strong> Teamwork is fundamental to the program because all real software projects are a collaborative effort, and sharing work enables students and their teams to produce more authentic work products.</p>
<h2>Research Programs</h2>
<p>Software Systems Engineering researchers are engaged in a broad range of exciting research projects, focused on mobile, embedded and cloud-based systems. Key topics include wireless sensors, networking, security, statistical methods, context-aware mobile applications, software craftsmanship and software verification. We research real world problems. We list all of our published research in this&#160;<a href="http://repository.cmu.edu/silicon_valley/">repository</a>.&#160;Our faculty obtain research grants, publish in leading conferences and archival journals, and bring their research into the classroom.<span>&#160;</span>Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, our campus is close to many of the world's most innovative companies. We draw on their top technical leaders for colloquia, teaching and research.</p>
