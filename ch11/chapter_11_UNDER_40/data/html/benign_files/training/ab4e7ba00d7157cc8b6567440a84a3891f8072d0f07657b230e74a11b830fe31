<h2>Drum Sequencer & Drum Sampler</h2>

<p>The Drum Sequencer has two different types of tracks, 'Stepsequencer Tracks' and 'Note Tracks':
<ol>
  <li><b>Stepsequencer Tracks</b> - Allows you to quickly create drum rhythms by manually selecting steps to create a drum pattern. The sequencer is available from Playlist tracks of type Drum. 

  <li><b>Note Tracks</b> - Created by default, when live-recording via the Drumpads OR from the <a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_Playlist.htm#channel_menu">Channel Menu > Add Notes Track</a>. The Note Tracks allow you to record/edit steps of varying lengths (including complex <b>Snap Settings</b>) which is something that the Stepsequencer Track doesn't offer.
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><b>To save a custom drumset</b> - Long-press the Channel Icon to open the <a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_Playlist.htm#channel_menu">Channel Menu</a> and use '<b>Save Template</b>'. This will save the current set of drums as a preset so you can load it again later. 
  <li><b>To load a custom drumset</b> - Tap the <b>(+)</b> Playlist button to add a track of type <b>Drum Sequencer</b>. Choose from <b>My Drumsets</b>.
</ul>

<h3>Working with the Stepsequencer</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Add / Remove Steps</b> - Tap Steps. The drum sound will be triggered on each active step.

  <li><b>Swing</b> - Opens a slider that allows you to add a 'swing' rhythm to Steps. Swing affects the length of odd vs even steps. If 4 beats per bar are set, 'swing' holds odd 16th notes (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) at the expense of even 16th notes (2,4,6,8,10,12 and 16) in the bar. The control determines the amount of swing. 

  <li><b>Add Drums</b> - Tap the (+) button at the bottom of the Stepsequencer. This will open a 'Browser'. You can also choose your own custom samples from the <b><a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_HomePanel.htm#userdata">My Samples</a></b> folder. After adding a sample tap the <b>Env.</b> tab to adjust the ADSR settings for the sample.


<p><a id="drumtrack_tabs"></a>

  <li><b>Drum Sampler</b> - The Drum Sampler is integrated with the Step Sequencer, and is another instrument specialized for playing single-shot percussion samples. The Drum Track can hold multiple samples making up a drum kit and allowing you to process each sound separately. Use the tabs to access controls:

   <ul>

     <li><b>Mixer</b> - <b>Solo</b> (hear only the selected drum sound), <b>Pan</b> (left/right position in the stereo field) and <b>Level</b> (volume) for the Drum channel.

     <li><b>Sample</b> - The controls include:

     <ul>
      
     <li><b>Pitch</b> - Master sample pitch. <b>NOTE:</b> There is also a per-step pitch control on the drag-up bar editors tab, as shown above.
     
     <li><b>Length</b> - Sample play-time. <b>NOTE:</b> A setting of 0 (100% left) is disabled, so start at the right and drag the slider to the left until you reach the desired length. Length interacts with the <b>Envelope > Release</b> setting, which should be set to minimum for the Length setting to have an effect. Afterward you can again tweak Release to achieve a less abrupt ending.  

    <li><b>AUX</b> - Sample routing. You can send the audio from the selected sample to any other <a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_Playlist.htm#add_track">Effects Track</a> (<b>AUX</b>) for separate processing to the host Drum Track 

    <li><b>Wave icon</b> - Load sample. To <b>Change samples</b> tap the <b>Wave icon</b> to open a sample browser. Choose a sample. You can also choose your own <b>custom samples</b> from the <b><a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_HomePanel.htm#userdata">My Samples</a></b> folder. After adding a sample tap the <b>Env.</b> tab to adjust the ADSR settings for the sample. 

   <p><b>Custom drum samples</b> - The Drum Sampler will look in the <a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_HomePanel.htm#userdata">My Recordings, My Samples and My Tracks</a> for <b>WAV</b> (16 / 32 Bit) and <b>MP3</b> format samples. If you put your own samples in these locations you can load custom drum sounds (as shown in the videos above).

    </ul>

     <li><b>Envelope</b> - <b>Attack</b>, <b>Decay</b>, <b>Sustain</b> and <b>Release</b> envelope. 
  <p class="justImages">
  <img src="../img_plug/flmobile_minisynth_adsr.png" width="450">

   </ul>

  <li><b>Add Notes Track</b> - Long-tap the <a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_Playlist.htm#channel_menu">Channel Menu</a> for the Drum Track to add a 'Notes Track'. This will allow you to set Snap values for steps and program in complex timings such as triplets or 1/64th notes.

</ul>

<h3>Creating Automation Clips</h3>
<p>You can automate most movable control on FL Studio Mobile. All knobs and sliders. To manually create an automation clip for a target:

<p class="justImages"><iframe width="700" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rd5aTY2UBnE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<ol>
  <li>Tweak/move the target control
  <li>Tap <b>CTRL</b> (<a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_Playlist.htm#flmobile_transportbar">Transport bar</a>)
  <li>Select '<b>Add Automation Track</b>'
  <li>Tap the Automation Track and add an empty Automation Clip 
  <li>Tap the Automation Clip and Edit 
  <li>Tap in points using the pop-up editor(see below)
</ol>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> If you are <b>recording</b> and move any parameter an Automation Track and Clip will be automatically created. You can go back in and edit the performance later.

<h4>Working with Automation Clips</h4> 
<p>Automation Clips can either be manually created OR can result from manual tweaking of a control while in Record mode. 

<p><a id="audioclips"></a>
<h2>Audio Clips</h2>
<p>When loading an <b>Audio Clip</b> track, FL Studio mobile will make available files in <a href="FL%20Studio%20Mobile_HomePanel.htm#userdata">FLM User Files\My Recordings, My Samples & My Tracks</a>. FL Studio Mobile supports 8, 16, 24 and 32 integer and IEEE float waves. *.wav format and .MP3 format. <b>NOTE:</b> MP3 format files include a very short period of silence at the start. This is part of the MP3 conversion process and can put critical timing events in the audio out of sync with the Playlist.   

  <p class="justImages">  <img src="../img_plug/flmobile_editor_wave.png" width="700">

<h3>Working with the Wave Editor</h3>
<p>Control Volume, Pan and Pitch with the tabs down the left side.
<ul>
  <li><b>Tap to add points</b> - Existing points can be dragged.
  <li><b>Delete points</b> - Tap and long-press point. Release to show delete option.
  <li><b>Vol, Pan, Pitch</b> - Choose an envelope to apply it to the Audio Clip.
