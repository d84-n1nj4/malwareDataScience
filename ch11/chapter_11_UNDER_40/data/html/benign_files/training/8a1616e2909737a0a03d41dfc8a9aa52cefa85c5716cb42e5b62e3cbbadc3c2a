          <h3 align="left"><a name="1"></a>How &quot;No Fault&quot; Works </h3>
          <p align="left">Michigan's &quot;No Fault&quot; statute was designed 
            to limit litigation, by shifting the risk of certain losses from automobile 
            accidents to the owner of the vehicle. For example, beyond Michigan's 
            &quot;mini-tort&quot; law, you are responsible to insure your own 
            vehicle and its contents against damage in an accident. If you choose 
            not to insure your vehicle for collision damage, even if you are 100% 
            innocent of blame in an accident, if the other driver is properly 
            insured your ability to recover from the other driver for property 
            damage is limited to a few hundred dollars under the <a href="http://www.michiganlegislature.org/mileg.asp?page=getObject&objName=mcl-500-3135">mini-tort 
            statute</a>, MCL 500.3135(3)(e). (This is why the statute is called 
            a &quot;No Fault&quot; statute &#8211; you are responsible for certain 
            costs regardless of who is at fault.)</p>
          <p align="left">Similarly, the cost of your medical care, lost wages 
            (ordinarily, awarded in the amount of 85% of your pre-accident gross 
            wages), and rehabilitation will ordinarily be paid by your own no 
            fault policy, or that of the owner of the car in which you were riding 
            &#8211; although &quot;excess&quot; wage losses (those beyond the 
            limits of your &quot;first party&quot; coverage) may be part of your 
            claim against the driver (or drivers) who caused the accident. In 
            short, most of your economic losses (out-of-pocket expenses) will 
            be paid by your own insurance company, while you can file a lawsuit 
            against the driver(s) who caused the accident for non-economic losses 
            (pain and suffering) and excess economic loss.</p>
          <p align="left">You will probably not be able to file a lawsuit against 
            the other driver if:</p>
          <div align="left"> 
            <ul>
              <li>You are more than 50% at fault for the accident;<BR>
              </li>
              <li>You owned the vehicle in which you were riding, and did not 
                carry a valid policy of insurance at the time of the accident.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p align="left">In relation to the obligation to insure your car, please 
            note that if you are not a resident of Michigan and are driving a 
            car that is registered in another state, you must carry Michigan no 
            fault insurance (or equivalent coverage) if the car is operated in 
            operated in Michigan for more than thirty days in any calendar year.</p>
          <p align="left"><strong><font color="#800000">Please note that you should 
            not depend upon anybody's assessment of who was at fault for an accident</font></strong>, 
            including the officer or police agency who drafts a report about the 
            accident. The fact that an officer indicates that you are at fault, 
            or even that the officer issues you a ticket, does not necessarily 
            mean that you will be unable to file a lawsuit. An attorney can help 
            you assess your right to sue.</p>
          <p align="left">The amount which you are able to recover may be reduced 
            if you were partially at fault for the accident. Your damages may 
            also be reduced by an amount up to five percent, if you were not wearing 
            a seatbelt at the time you were injured.</p>
          <h3 align="left"><a name="2"></a>&quot;Serious Impairment of a Body 
            Function&quot;</h3>
          <p align="left">As part of its effort to limit lawsuits over injuries 
            caused in automobile accidents, recovery for &quot;pain and suffering&quot; 
            (non-economic damages) for accident-related injuries is limited to 
            cases where the person making the claim suffered death, serious impairment 
            of an important body function, or permanent serious disfigurement. 
            The injury must also be &quot;objectively manifested&quot; &#8211; 
            that is, some soft tissue injuries cannot support a lawsuit, as doctors 
            will not be able to find any objective evidence that the injury exists. 
            (This doesn't mean that the injury doesn't exist, or that the accident 
            victim doesn't suffer very real pain or disability &#8211; it means 
            only that, under Michigan law, not all injuries will support a lawsuit.) 
            Typically, medical findings of muscle spasm and trigger points will 
            be considered to be objective manifestations of an injury.</p>
          <p align="left">A &quot;serious impairment of body function&quot; is 
            an injury that affects your ability to live a normal life. This can 
            include an impairment of your ability to walk, or to engage in more 
            basic functions such as breathing. This standard also contemplates 
            your normal life &#8211; if you are a concert pianist, you may be 
            able to recover damages for an injury to your hand which impairs your 
            ability to play the piano, even though the injury might not meet the 
            threshold for recovery for a person whose daily life does not require 
            a comparable level of dexterity. The duration of the disability may 
            affect a court's determination of whether the impairment was serious, 
            or its effect on your normal life. Given two people with the same 
            injury, a very active person may be able to show a threshold impairment, 
            while a &quot;couch potato&quot; may not be able to establish that 
            his life was significantly affected by the injury. Closed head injuries 
            are subject to special rules. Ordinarily, you should not try to guess 
            for yourself if your injuries meet this threshold, but should only 
            make the assessment in consultation with a lawyer.</p>
          <p align="left">This &quot;threshold&quot; rule does not apply to claims 
            for economic damages, such as a claim for excess wage losses.</p>
          <h3 align="left"><a name="3"></a>Claims Against Your Recovery</h3>
          <p align="left">If any of your medical expenses relating to the accident 
            have been paid by a government agency, such as Medicare or Medicaid, 
            or even workers' compensation, the government may have the right to 
            recover those expenses from any amount you recover in your lawsuit. 
            Similarly, if you have medical expenses relating to your accident 
            which have not been paid by your insurance company, the medical care 
            provider may be able to assert a claim against your recovery. Please 
            inform your attorney of any such payments or obligations. Given advance 
            notice, your attorney will probably be able to negotiate a settlement 
            which will maximize the amount of money you personally recover. However, 
            if your attorney is surprised, it may turn out that a substantial 
            amount of your settlement or verdict &#8211; and perhaps all of it 
            &#8211; is paid to satisfy those liens.</p>
          <h3 align="left"><a name="4"></a>Uninsured and Underinsured Defendants 
          </h3>
          <p align="left">In some cases, the driver of the car which causes the 
            accident won't be insured, or will have an inadequate amount of insurance. 
            Michigan no fault policies will offer a certain amount of &quot;uninsured 
            motorist&quot; coverage, which will entitle you to make a claim for 
            your pain and suffering with your own insurance company. Some insurance 
            providers also allow you to obtain &quot;underinsured motorist&quot; 
            coverage, which will allow you to recover an additional amount if 
            the other driver has inadequate coverage to reimburse you for your 
            non-economic and excess economic losses. Please note that there are 
            usually very technical requirements for making underinsurance claims 
            which, if violated, may prevent you from recovering benefits. You 
            should read your policy carefully, and may benefit from an attorney's 
            advice in making such a claim.</p>
          <h3 align="left"><a name="5"></a>Finding All Responsible Parties </h3>
          <p align="left">In some cases, there will be people who may be sued 
            beyond the at-fault driver. For example, if the at-fault driver did 
            not own the car, the owner of the car will typically also be liable 
            for your damages. If the at-fault driver was impaired through the 
            consumption of alcohol, it may be possible to bring a &quot;dram shop&quot; 
            complaint against a business who served alcohol to the driver before 
            the accident while he was visibly impaired. In some cases, it may 
            be possible to bring an action alleging that a defect in the vehicle 
            or the roadway caused or contributed to the accident. In cases involving 
            a tractor-trailer, there may be violations of rules and regulations 
            by the driver or the driver's employer, which can support a cause 
            of action.</p>
          <h3 align="left"><a name="6"></a>Statute of Limitations</h3>
          <p align="left">Note that, as of the time this was written, there is 
            a three year statute of limitations for personal injury claims against 
            the at-fault driver(s). A highway defect claim must ordinarily be 
            filed within two years of the accident. A dram shop claim ordinarily 
            requires that notice be given to any tavern which may be at fault 
            within 120 days of the accident, and that a lawsuit be filed within 
            two years. If you are considering making a claim, you should consult 
            with a lawyer as soon as possible after the accident, so as to avoid 
            having your claim barred by the statute of limitations, and to avoid 
            the possibility that you will miss your opportunity to file a claim 
            should the legislature shorten the limitations period.</p>
