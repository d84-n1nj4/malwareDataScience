<div class="news">SleepCare and Philips Bring World Class Sleep Disorders Treatment to India</div><p><strong>Hyderabad, India, January 27, 2011</strong></p>
<p>SleepCare Solutions (SCS), a Hyderabad based sleep solutions (<a href="http://www.sleepcareindia.com/">www.sleepcareindia.com</a>) enterprise launched their first state-of-the-art SleepCare facility in India along the guidelines of The Joint Commission (JCAHO) and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), to help patients and manage their sleep disorders. The first facility has begun its operations in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad. Dr. Lavanya Gali, Medical Director at SCS, a board-certified specialist in the areas of sleep medicine, will lead the medical practice in the organization.</p>
<p>SleepCare is a dedicated facility that offers comprehensive approach for the diagnosis and treatment of adult sleep disorders using the latest technology and therapeutic options.</p>
<p>Making the announcement Dr. Lavanya said, “We are excited to open our first independent sleep disorder testing facility in India in collaboration with Philips India. We are committed to play a major role to solve the sleep disorder problems facing the Indian subcontinent by combining Philips medical technology and SleepCare sleep medicine know-how”.</p>
<p>According to Sleep Medicine experts World over the socio-economic consequences of the sleep disorders snoring, sleep apnoea, and obesity-related respiratory difficulties affect large portion of the population. It is important for people with sleep disorders to get in touch with the health service; otherwise their health, education, ability to work, and thereby their finances may be affected.</p>
<p>Dr. Walters is also on the Editorial Board of the Journal Sleep Medicine. In his message Dr. Walters said, I am happy to have one of my mentees open a sleep disorder center in a country where sleep medicine is underdeveloped and the need for it is so great.  The increased mortality and morbidity associated with sleep apnea, a common disorder, make this a vital and important endeavor.</p>
<p>Dr. Arthur Walters, a senior advisor, one of the world’s foremost practitioners and thought leaders in the areas of sleep medicine has joined the board of Sleepcare. Before joining Vanderbilt University, Tennessee, Dr. Walters was the Director of the Center for Sleep Disorders Treatment, Research and Education at the New Jersey Neuroscience Institute at JFK Medical Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Philips Sleep Survey, conducted in Dec. 2009 by The Nielsen Company showed that 93 per cent of Indians are sleep deprived; getting less than the 8 hours of sleep they need per day. An astonishing 11 per cent of Indians took leave from work because of their lack of sleep. This survey was conducted among 5600 respondents in the age group of 35 to 65 years across 25 cities in urban India with population of 5lakh and upwards.</p>
<p>“Prevalence of sleep disorders in India is highest in the world. At our SleepCare facility in India we have a team of world-class team of sleep experts backed by state-of-the-art facility that meets and exceeds international standards. Our aim is to create dedicated facility to cater sleep disorder diagnosis, treatment, sleep education and clinical research in India. Our intent is to offer holistic health approach to address this emerging problem.” Vamsi Maddipatla, president of SCS is a serial entrepreneur said, Maddipatla has built successful businesses in the areas of healthcare and life science in both USA and India.</p>
<p>With increasing demand for sleep disorder tests, sleep centers, physicians and technicians need tools and services that offer improved scoring consistency and efficiency; enabling them to focus on those parts of the sleep study and other activities that require their professional expertise. At Philips India goal is to help improve the productivity of sleep centers and is based on the most advanced and clinically validated automated-scoring technology on the market. Satyakam Sarma, Philips India Healthcare said.</p>
<p>Speaking about SleepCare plans ahead Prashant Koirala, Director of Corporate Development, who has worked in the areas of investment banking and private equity in USA, said, “Our goal is to launch 25 new centers in the next 2 years in India, Middle East and South East Asia. We will continue to partner with world’s best research institutions and corporations like Philips in the areas of sleep and bring the know-how to India.”</p>
<p>SleepCare has invested over INR 1 Crore in setting up the first facility and plans invest INR 20 Cores in the next 2 years.</p>
<p>BCC Research estimates that the value of the global market for sleep aids was an estimated $25 billion in 2009, but is expected to increase to more than $33 billion in 2014, for a 5-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8%. Sleep laboratories, the second largest category in the segment, is estimated at $6.7 billion in 2009, is expected to increase at a 5-year CAGR of 6.5% to reach more than $9.2 billion in 2014. India is a major market for disorders since 93 percent of Indians are sleep deprived (Philips, Nielsen Study)</p>
<p>According to SleepCare Medicine Experts some people are just genetically poor sleepers and giving them something to help overcome their natural problems is something SleepCare intent to offer. Sleep apnea, Insomnia, Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, Narcolepsy are other common sleep disorder which is much more than we think. And, anyone can get it.</p>
<p>A sleep disorder (somnipathy) is a medical disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal. Some sleep disorders are serious enough to interfere with normal physical, mental and emotional functioning. The demand for sleep disorder treatments globally is rising. Since the opening a sleep clinic in worldwide has seen increase in number of patients. The average wait to get into the clinic is four months.</p>
