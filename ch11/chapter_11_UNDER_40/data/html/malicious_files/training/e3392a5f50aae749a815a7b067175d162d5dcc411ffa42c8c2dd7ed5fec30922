		<summary type="html"> &lt;p&gt;Sunrise, also known as Sunrise Boulevard, is a neighborhood in the city of Long Beach, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally a ranch, then a milk sanitarium, this neighborhood developed adjacent to the Pacific Electric Railway line. Homes are predominantly Craftsman Bungalows, constructed between 1908-1924, ranging from large mansions to small-scale workers' housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An early motor court, the El Cortez, was built in the early Twenties on the site of the sanitarium; today, it provides small apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, this district is a blend of small-scale bungalows built for the working class, large-scale Craftsman homes built for prominent and prosperous citizens, and mid-scale bungalows in the Craftsman and Spanish Colonial Revival styles built for the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunrise is bordered by the Pacific Electric Railway right-of-way to the south, the city of Signal Hill to the east, Willow Street to the north, and Atlantic Avenue to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the south of Sunrise is the Central Long Beach area and to the west is Wrigley, and the city of Signal Hill is to the north and east.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html"> &lt;p&gt;There are two very different &quot;Eastsides&quot; in Long Beach. One is more often referred to as &quot;East Long Beach&quot; and is geographically the northeastern portion of the city. The common-usage &quot;Eastside&quot; is geographically the central portion of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Eastside Long Beach&quot; familiar to hip-hop fans is an area on the east side of the Los Angeles River and 710 Freeway(closer to the center of Long Beach) and is associated with a number of Long Beach rap artists, such as Snoop Dogg, Canidate, Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Likwid E, Bad Azz, Warren G, Nate Dogg, Crooked I, Soopafly, Techniec and RBX . Snoop Dogg went to Polytechnic High School The boundaries for this second Eastside are (very roughly) Willow Street and the Signal Hill city limits (N), Cherry Ave. (E), Seventh St. (S), and the Los Angeles River (W).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rappers Snoop Dogg, Warren G, and Nate Dogg, as well as Snoop Dogg's Tha Eastsidaz, are all from Eastside Long Beach. The VIP Records store which has been featured in music videos by Snoop Dogg and other rap music artists is at the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. in Eastside Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This term &quot;Eastside&quot; is a catch-all and the area encompasses many smaller neighborhoods, including several of the official Historic Districts designated by the City of Long Beach and the Cambodia Town district. The area is often referred to as &quot;Central Long Beach&quot; by newspapers, city officials and real estate agents, but the term &quot;Eastside&quot; is still most commonly used by residents. The area's major thoroughfares are Anaheim Street, Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1) and 7th Street east to west; and Pacific Avenue, Long Beach Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue north to south. The LA Metro Transit Authority Blue Line light rail runs in the center of Long Beach Boulevard beginning at Willow Ave and has stops at throughout the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most streets are fairly narrow, and usually lined with cars throughout the day, as many residents of the area do not have a garage or assigned parking space available. The architecture of the neighborhood varies, it may include craftsman-style homes and bungalows dating back to the pre-WWII era, as well as small apartment complexes built during and shortly after the war. What little newer housing exists in the neighborhood is generally built from public funds as part of various urban renewal efforts by the City; an example of this are the townhouses along Atlantic Ave north of Pacific Coast Highway in an area referred to as &quot;Renaissance Square&quot; by City Hall. While there are no large-scale public housing projects on the East Side, the neighborhood has several &quot;workforce housing&quot; areas, as well as many smaller apartment complexes and other dwellings that are owned by the city Housing Authority or subsidized by public funds to offer lower rents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcrowding is evident in the neighborhood, it is frequent to see a three or four-unit apartment structure standing behind an older house on the same lot. There had been some gentrification of the area in the 2000s, due to its relative proximity to the beach (the beachfront is walking distance from many areas of the Eastside), the downtown and the CSU Long Beach Campus. Developers bought up several apartment complexes in the area and converted them into condominiums, only to see housing demand collapse in the 2007/2008 housing slump, causing many of these developments to sit empty for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eastside is also marked by heavy small-business retail activity, especially in the storefronts that line Anaheim Street, 7th Street and Pacific Coast Highway. Many of these businesses are owned by immigrants and include restaurants, discount clothing stores, and automotive repair shops. So many businesses along a stretch of Anaheim Street are owned by Cambodian immigrants that the city has named the area &quot;Cambodia Town&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The East, West-, and Northwest side are the neighborhoods in Long Beach that have the worst reputation for crime, both locally and globally. The area has long been plagued with gang violence, and is home to numerous gangs including two rival Crip factions, gangs affiliated with the Mexican Mafia, Sons Of Samoa Crips and some of the oldest mixed Samoan and other ethnicity street gangs in the United States including the 15 street Suicidals. Ethnic tensions that have developed since the 1980s have added a new dimension to gang violence in the neighborhood (as it has in much of the Los Angeles area), especially tensions between Asians and Chicanos. Homelessness, drug abuse and prostitution are all also found at well above-average rates in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Beach Polytechnic High School, known for its connection to several rap artists as well as its powerhouse athletic programs, is located on the East Side on Atlantic Ave just south of Pacific Coast Hwy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area, while historically an African-American neighborhood, is inhabited by a mixed population that includes a heavy Hispanic concentration (predominantly Mexican-American) as well as one of the largest Samoan and Cambodian populations in the United States. There have also been a decent number of findings of caucasian residents, mainly in the historic district areas of the city. Due to the low rents throughout the Eastside, the area has also attracted many students who attend nearby CSU Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood includes all or portions of ZIP codes 90813, 90806, 90804, 90802 and 90815. It is adjacent to Downtown Long Beach, Alamitos Beach, Belmont Heights, Wrigley and the Traffic Circle, as well as the City of Signal Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East Long Beach is a large area of Long Beach that is west of Interstate 605 (San Gabriel Freeway) and north of Interstate 405 (San Diego Freeway). The large El Dorado Park (which includes a golf course and nature center) forms the eastern boundary, and the city of Lakewood and Heartwell Park is to the north. Lakewood Boulevard and the Long Beach Municipal Airport form the western boundary. It can be differentiated from the other &quot;Eastside&quot; in that it is usually referred to in the media and in official business as &quot;East Long Beach.&quot; This neighborhood is the geographic Eastern Northeast quadrant of the City of Long Beach, and generally consists of low-density housing, single family, detached homes built in the Post-WWII era. Most of the major streets through the area are wide boulevards of the type favored in construction of Postwar suburbs, and lined with trees. It is virtually indistinguishable in an architectural sense from neighboring Lakewood, and much of this section was developed as part of Lakewood and later annexed into Long Beach. East Long Beach's main thoroughfares are Palo Verde Ave, Bellflower Blvd, Clark Ave, Studebaker Rd, Los Coyotes Diagonal north to south and Willow Street, Spring Street, Wardlow Rd and Carson Street east to west. Like its inner-city counterpart, East Long Beach is a catch-all term for a wide geographic area that includes smaller neighborhoods, including Plaza, Carson Park, South of Conant, and Lakewood Village. The western boundary to this area is vague, but in general, any area east of the Long Beach Airport that is in the City of Long Beach is considered East Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millikan High School, part of the Long Beach Unified School District, is at the Palo Verde Avenue and Spring Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood is predominantly white middle-class, however recent years have seen an increase in numbers of upwardly-mobile minorities living in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood consists of all or portions of the 90815, 90808 and 90803 ZIP codes and is adjacent to the Traffic Circle, the California State University, Long Beach campus, the Los Angeles County cities of Lakewood and Hawaiian Gardens, and the Orange County cities of Cypress and Los Alamitos.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html"> &lt;p&gt;Cambodia Town is the official name for a roughly one mile long business corridor along Anaheim Street between Atlantic and Junipero avenues in Long Beach, California. The area has numerous Cambodian restaurants, clothing stores, and jewelry stores, as well as churches, temples, and service centers for Cambodian-Americans . There are many other businesses in the area, such as auto repair shops, that are Cambodian-owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known as the &quot;Cambodian capital of the United States&quot;, Long Beach is believed to have 50,000 Cambodian residents (although 2000 census figures put the number at 20,000). It is believed to be home to the second largest population of Cambodian immigrants outside Southeast Asia (there are approximately 1.4 million Cambodians in Thailand and approximately 1,055,174 in southern Vietnam where they are known as Khmer Krom) after the city of Paris, France. The city has its own Cambodian consulate. Many of the Cambodians in Long Beach came to the United States as refugees from Democratic Kampuchea from 1975 to 1979, as well as the 1978 invasion and occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam. Many settled around Anaheim Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Long Beach also has an annual Cambodian New Year celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2001, some local Cambodian community activists worked to obtain Long Beach city council approval to officially designated the Anaheim Street corridor as &quot;Cambodia Town&quot;. Some community activists preferred the name of &quot;Little Phnom Penh.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some community members questioned any official designation for the area, saying that it could increase the Cambodian-Latino rivalry in the area, and that official recognization for a single ethnic community would be divisive in the ethnically diverse city of Long Beach. On October 25, 2006, the city council voted for a 90-day review period to allow more input from the community. In the end, official approval was obtained at the city council meeting on July 3rd, 2007: &quot;After lengthy discussion and several public comments, the City Council voted 8-1 to designate the stretch of Anaheim Street between Junipero Avenue and Atlantic Boulevard as Cambodia Town. The area houses many Cambodian businesses, and Long Beach is home to about 17,000 Cambodian-Americans, according to the city.&quot; Published on July 4, 2007, Long Beach Press-Telegram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Beach Public Library operates the Mark Twain Public Library. It opened on August 11, 2007. It was the first newly-constructed library to open in the city in over 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
