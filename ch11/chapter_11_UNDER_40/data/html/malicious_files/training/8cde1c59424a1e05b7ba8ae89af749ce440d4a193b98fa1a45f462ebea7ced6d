These roles have given her a strong understanding of  diverse community needs across a broad range of businesses and  organizations and the ability to work with communities in a  collaborative and inclusive manner.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Luke Donnellan, MP</h5>
<h3>Influence in Education Testimonials</h3>
<p><em>“The marketing success we saw at our school during Patrizia’s  watch was so much a function of her imaginative, innovative mind  especially as she positioned the campaign to capture the ‘first  generation’ independent school parent.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Tony Conabere, former Principal and Director Janus Consulting</h5>
<p><em>“The professionalism, expertise and commitment of Spheres of  Influence International staff is synonymous with the core work of RFDS.  The quality of the end product is excellent. I am delighted beyond  expectation with the outcome.”</em><strong></strong></p>

<p><em>“… has linked in extremely well with our integrated topic of Australian History.<strong>“</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Teacher</h5>
<p>“…was an excellent way for students to interact with one another and share knowledge<strong>”</strong></p>
<h5>Teacher</h5>
<p><em>“…has been extremely positive. Our teachers love the fact that  all the lessons linked and they are able to use the knowledge gained in  previous lessons to discuss new ideas.

<h5>Deputy Principal, Western Australia</h5>
<p><em>“Patrizia has a strong passion for cultural change and engagement  of the wider community.

<h5>Luke Donnellan, MP</h5>
<h3>Influence in Sport Testimonials</h3>
<p><em>“Spheres of Influence have a very broad and thorough knowledge  of the sports industry; complimented by its creative, strategic and  innovative thinking which is extremely helpful in motivating staff  members and Board Directors alike.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Neil Dalrymple, CEO, Bowls Australia</h5>
<p><em>“Patrizia successfully negotiated on behalf of Cricket Australia  with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship an important and  strategic partnership that significantly advanced the public and  community relations and business objectives of the two entities. She  demonstrated excellent communication and liaison skills and presented  the perspectives and position of her organisation in a courteous and  professional manner. She has respected the position and points of view  of the other party and negotiated with integrity and in good faith.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Doug Stewart, Department of Immigration and Citizenship</h5>
<p><em>“The teaching materials Patrizia produced for Cricket Australia  combined the best of learning pedagogies with the best of coaching  lessons, something that I had not seen achieved before. That she managed  to get two such diverse traditions onto the same page with such  brilliant effect is a tribute to her special expertise.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Tony Conabere, Educational Leader and Director, Janus Consulting<strong> </strong></h5>
<p><em>“I feel privileged to have known and worked with Patrizia for  many years. Thoroughly professional in all aspects of her business  career Patrizia thrives on challenges and whilst respecting tradition  she is at the same time an innovative and clear thinking  leader. Patrizia’s enthusiasm is infectious and her expertise in  blending lessons learned in the education sector into the sporting  landscape is unsurpassed.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Ken Jacobs, Director, Ken Jacobs and Associates</h5>
<p><em>“Patrizia has led this work to be a leading sport and recreation  provider for culturally and linguistically diverse communities in  Victoria and together with the Victoria Police Soccer Club, has  contributed significantly to the lives of young people and their  families by providing much needed support in the form of time,  resources, equipment, apparel, and sometimes just the simple things like  friendship and human contact.</em><strong>”</strong></p>
<h5>Vincent Manno, Detective Leading Senior Constable, Secretary – Victoria Police Soccer Club</h5>
<p><em>“Patrizia has been responsible for the excellent delivery of a number of leadership programs and solutions for business.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Luke Donnellan, MP</h5>
<h3>Influence in Community Testimonials<strong></strong></h3>
<p><em>“Patrizia understands that government departments are responsible  for public monies and answerable to Parliament and usually operate  within legislative frameworks. These formalities can complicate and slow  negotiations. During the development of the partnership between this  department and Cricket Australian, she demonstrated patience and  perseverance. Consequently, the department and Cricket Australia were  able to reach agreement, work collaboratively and implement an important  national project that is mutually beneficial. I congratulate her on  this successful outcome and recommend her for any senior liaison,  advocacy or public relations role that engages the public and  government.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Doug Stewart, Department of Immigration &amp; Citizenship</h5>
<p><em>“Patrizia can get a job done! She has a very sharp mind, the  capacity to analyse a problem, to cost and plan a solution and the  resolution to work with colleagues to see that solution realised.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Tony Conabere, Director Janus Consulting</h5>
<p><em>“A very well organised session…an immediate feeling of being part of a team working in the same direction.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Janet Larwood, School of Isolated and Distance Education, Western Australia</h5>
<p>“Thank you for giving me the opportunity to experience your program.  In teaching we never get to see a program and give feedback or trial it  before we are expected to teach it so your process is rare. My class is  very excited about trialing the resource.”<strong></strong></p>
<h5>Barbara Barker, Teacher</h5>
<p><em>“At all times the support and communication from Spheres of  Influence International has been timely and detailed with no delay in  response time or sharing of information.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Belinda Pearson, Teacher</h5>
<p><em>“Patrizia’s ability to strategically communicate with diverse  people from different levels, ranging from government departments  through to the grass roots levels of various communities, allows her to  keep abreast of local and impacting issues, whilst simultaneously  forming sustainable alliances to overcome these issues.  Her leadership  assists communities in tackling the barriers they face on a daily basis  and offers activities, employment and training to CALD communities with  the aim of improving self esteem, leadership skills, less at risk  behaviour and increased community involvement.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Vincent Manno, Detective Leading Senior Constable, Secretary – Victoria Police Soccer Club</h5>
<p><em>“As an experienced senior manager, Patrizia has a positive  leadership style which produces high levels of respect and loyalty. Her  presentation and communication skills are of a high standard and she has  a proven track record of risk management, problem solving and issues  resolution. Her sound knowledge and experience of governance,  legislation policies and constitutional compliance ensures she is able  to work her way through issues involving local, state and federal  government with ease.”</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Luke Donnellan, MP</h5>
<h3>360 Personal Brand Testimonials</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;My 360 Personal Brand review provided me with an accurate  account of my value to the organisation. The testimonials from clients,  suppliers and industry peers allowed me to negotiate a better package  during annual salary talks. My Board of Directors were impressed with  the ‘reality’ of my reputational value and what I actually bring to the  business.&#8221;</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>CEO, Australia</h5>
<p><em>&#8220;My 360 Personal Brand review highlighted my skills, expertise  and strong knowledge base across a number of arenas. I knew I was doing  it, but I had never really articulated it before. Once people knew that I  was interested in National Board roles, the opportunities started to  present themselves.&#8221;</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Independent Director, Australia</h5>
<p><em>&#8220;My 360 Personal Brand review gave me the confidence to apply for  roles that I would never have believed were possible for me. The  testimonials from my reviewers were as good as references and the  credibility of the information I was able to use was unquestionable.&#8221;</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Senior Manager, Australia</h5>
<p><em>&#8220;The writing was on the wall for me, so my 360 Personal Brand  review was a timely investment in myself. The confidential report gave  me the facts about my reputation and true strengths from a business  perspective and the ‘Road Map’ led me to improve my chances of  succeeding in a new role. It would have turned out quite differently if  I’d simply waited for the axe to fall.&#8221;</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Senior Manager, Australia</h5>
<p><em>&#8220;I really wanted to build my reputation as an ‘authority’ in my  specialist field. My 360 Personal Brand review helped me leverage my  profile and I can see that the requests to present at state and national  conferences and write articles for publication will only increase with  time.&#8221;</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>Conference Presenter, Australia</h5>
<p><em>&#8220;Our Board of Directors weren’t aware of the skills gap that  existed on our Board so we commissioned a customised ‘Review’ from  Spheres of Influence which resulted in a succession plan and retention  strategy that will see our organisation thrive for many years to come.&#8221;</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>CEO, National Not for Profit Organisation</h5>
<p><em>&#8220;Our National Team underwent a Review of their brand value in  terms of media recognition. The result is that we now have a ‘media  communications plan’ for each of our National Athletes that combines a  mix of media training and local, state and national media exposure that  is building our organisational brand as well as that of the  individuals.&#8221;</em><strong></strong></p>
<h5>CEO, National Sporting Organisation</h5>
<p><em>&#8220;We wanted to provide Staff with an ‘employer of choice’ program  aligned with the organisation’s desire to reward, recognise and retain  good staff by investing in their future. Aligned with our performance  appraisal process, strategic goals, values and marketing objectives,  Spheres designed a 360 Personal Brand Review that suited us perfectly  and gave our team confidence in the fact that the results would not be  used to expose weakness, but rather reinforce strengths.&#8221;</em><strong></strong></p>
