The idea?of a high sock design is definitely new to the market, something that goes against the normal expectations of soccer players.?Bear in mind that this boot?remains in design phase and is essentially a “concept model”, but the goal for adidas is to have something?released by the end of this year.?The one piece design and strong light yarns of the?Primeknit FS?is expected to provide new levels of flexibility and comfort with stability and strength equal to that of conventional boots, as the story goes. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/451485931371767273/">Release Nike Mercurial CR7 Superfly 4 2014 TF Blue $61.00</a> <b>dfo football boots</b> 
#gallery-41949-1-slideshow .slideshow-slide img{max-height:410px;_height:expression(this.scrollHeight>= 410 ? '410px' : 'auto');}Eden Hazard's Custom Mercurial VaporEden Hazard is the only player featured that isn't getting a pair of boots for his departure from his club. Instead, Nike gave him a pair of custom Vapors to celebrate his special season with Chelsea and many awards that he has accumulated. Some of his stats for the 2014/15 Premier League season are 14 goals and 9 assists, and he has been a vital part of Chelsea's Premier League win. The boots feature a CR7 like HAZARD print on the instep in blue with a lightning bolt design. The outside of the boot also features blue lightning like bolts on a white base. The boots also have a timestamp on the heel with his initials and a French phrase which translates to Nothing touches me . Hazard received the only pair in existence from Nike, which definitely makes it a special pair!
