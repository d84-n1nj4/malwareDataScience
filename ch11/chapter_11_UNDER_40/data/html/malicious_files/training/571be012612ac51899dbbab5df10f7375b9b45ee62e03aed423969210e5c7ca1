<h2>WELCOME</h2>
<p>We moved to Winchester Ma., U.S.A. and began this Z.5 garden in 1987. Aside from an evergreen hedge, and various mature maples and conifers, nothing that you now see – was here.</p>
<p>There were no fences and the back of our property was a wild woodland of junk trees and scrub. We began our landscape design by laying out garden beds that were visible from key viewpoints in our house. As new gardeners, our interest was in perennial plants, particularly peonies , Siberian iris and daylilies. Our property had a variety of sun and shade situations and we dove into researching the vast world of Zone 5 -hardy perennials. We joined the Mass.Horticultural Society and The Garden Conservancy, subscribed to Horticulture and Fine Gardening magazines, attended many classes and workshops, and visited as many gardens as possible. And we learned volumes from garden owners, teachers, classmates and vendors.</p>
<p>After three years of intense garden development, our gardens were awarded the &#8220;Best in Show&#8221; prize in an amateur gardeners competition sponsored by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and Boston Magazine. For our prize, we were sent to Holland, where, at Trompenberg Arboretum, we discovered the wonderful world of conifers. This life-changing experience took us out of our perennials focus and raised our vision, literally and figuratively, so that we began to emphasize the &#8216;bones’ of our gardens- with conifers, shrubs and trees. Visiting private and public arboretums and gardens in New England, the Pacific Northwest and England- we further developed our passion for these plants, particularly for Japanese maples, dwarf conifers and variegated trees and shrubs.Ever aware of the peaceful influence of running water in the garden, we put in a number of fountains and built a series of waterfall/ponds- to mask the traffic noise and provide some quiet sitting spots. Over the years, various pieces of garden art, quirky, beautiful or funny, have found their way in and taken up residence.</p>
<p>If this is your first visit, you will be surprised how different the gardens look from one week to the next. In the spring, perennials are short, there are many empty spots, and the gardens have a much more open feeling. You can see from one area to the next. In the summer, plants grow taller and fill in so that the various gardens become their own ’garden rooms’. Fences disappear and flowering vines ramble over railings,walls and obelisks. By September, the plants are at their tallest,highlighted by the many ornamental grasses.</p>
<p>Things we hope you will notice: The role of purple foliage , yellow foliage and variegated foliage in keeping your eyes entertained; The role of varying heights in a garden bed; The role of hidden elements and glimpses of vistas &#8211; in drawing you into the various garden areas; The role of water elements; The roles of garden art and architecture. We are so glad you have come to share our gardens. Please bring friends and come back often.</p>
<p>**And remember- When you see a gate, open it and explore!!**</p>

<h3>Imagine My Surprise!:<br />Behind the Curtains at The Cotton-Arbo  retum</h3>
<p>So, my beloved partner in all things and gardening, Dudley, and I , were sitting at late dinner one night …after planting a few shrubs and trees and perennials … after Dudley had returned from a day of golf… after our morning spent planting. Just 10 days before, we had returned from our yearly nursery touring B’day trip to Ct. with a steamed-windows-van packed so full that pots were nestled on pots and the top 3’ of a 12’ tree stretched discretely between our seats so we could barely move, much less see out the rearview mirror. The past ten days had flown by with a wide diversity of activities: thinking about where to put things in the garden, making lists of where to put things in the garden, researching the special needs of new plants to be planted in the garden, re-thinking where to put things in the garden, making new lists of where to put things in the garden, planting in the garden, digging up new plants just planted in the garden and rotating them or repositioning them in their holes and replanting them in the garden, digging up those things just planted and re-locating them entirely in the garden, digging up things that were planted earlier in the garden ( the previous day, week, month, year or decade) and moving them to entirely new places in the garden, revising the lists of where to put things in the garden, planting in the garden, watering and staking what’s just been planted in the garden, and so many more varied activities. So, as Dudley and I were finishing our late night dinner, after I had finished telling him about the day’s plantings, imagine my surprise when he hesitatingly said, “Mindy, I think you need to get a little less intense about this planting stuff.” Now, tell me, dear friends, whatever could he mean?</p>

<h3>Tour Groups and The Cotton-Arbo  retum</h3>
<p>The Cotton-Arbo  retum has received many garden club visits and we are delighted to host all garden groups, whether official or informal.  Groups should allow 40-60 minutes to see the gardens. We can also provide a talk on the plants and design concepts on display in the garden, followed by a Q and A session.  There are plenty of shaded benches throughout the gardens. There is a handicapped entrance and a number of garden areas are wheelchair accessible. We will provide your group with bathroom access and fresh iced tea. For groups that are seeking a full day of tours and nursery visits, we can make suggestions and help coordinate that for you. Upon request, plants from our collection can be made available. </p>
