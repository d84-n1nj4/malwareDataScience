if ALL of us were Oracles there would be no such thing as foresight. What is
amazing to me is that so many of our Black writers, politicians and media
people (with the exception of Tavis Smiley who displayed some Oracle talents
and was thoroughly castigated and even fired from his BET Gig). There was never
a doubt in my mind that the Right wing of the GOP (with their STOP HILLARY
EXPRESS) and the lack of sophistication of the great majority black voters in
states that counted i.e. SC (has anyone seen Clybrun on TV lately?) that pushed
Obama into the nomination and subsequent win which any DEM would have won
except perhaps the short guy from OHIO with the good looking wife. The GOP could
not lose (Obama being the only one they had any chance of beating and since
they were going to lose why not lose to some one who could NOT be re-elected in
four years. To say that Obama has surrounded himself with in competent is weak
He had not and still has not been here long enough to know WHO to trust the
learning curve is and has been far too great. He is surrounded by idiots and as
you say Clarence he continues to protect them. Another thing to consider is
that the ONLY people who are serving him well are former Clinton people WHY
Because politicians as they are they KNOW that there are no permanent friends
in that arena AND also NO permanent enemies. The sad truth is as I have said
from the start the country is too rich too FAIL and the Big Losers will be us
Blacks who have done nothing BUT lose ground since the election in a BIG way
and we will continue to lose ground as the COURT becomes more to the RIGHT or
Center which is very little consolation for us who are STILL too FAR behind in
everything and the move to the middle class has been far too few for the
programs that propelled MOST of us continue to recede. One last thing the
blacks in Congress (which will start to thin with NONE in the SENATE unless
FORD can pull off an upset) the ones in the house with the change in the Voting
Rights ACT will be more than cut in half in the next six years knew this but
had to be for Obama because their constituents, most of which had no idea what
they were doing but were voting (probably for the first time) made them do it.
Isn't that sad? But worse than that they are the ones who will suffer the most
. I say it is a high price to pay for the reflected glory that we have had for
the first few months and the EXTREME pleasure we Continue to enjoy in SPITE of the&nbsp;PAIN
that we have to know is SURE to COME. Think about it To continue to say this is
what we inherited is not the answer anyone WHO was running should have KNOWN
that whatever they found was WHY they were elected in the first place. A new
broom is suppose to SWEEP Clean.</span></strong><span style="color: black">

  	<div class='Fulltext'>...the plight of blacks –what exactly is<br />such a plight from your vantage point? You write that you are not concerned<br />with his job performance, that he is unable to do anything for blacks;<br />specifically, what can he do for blacks that you would find good? This is<br />politics in the 21st century. There are many others in this country<br />who are as marginalized as blacks – yet not with the same history as blacks. It<br />would be political suicide to provide programs specifically for a certain race<br />while excluding others. You’ve seen the uproar with Affirmative Action –though<br />the spirit of this program is rightly due.  Furthermore this would<br />exacerbate our plight as we stand be further alienated from our fellow citizens<br />of other races whom may well be as marginalized?<br /><br />On your argument against comparing him<br />with other presidents, Obama has to do something extraordinary different –for<br />the benefit of blacks, which would constitute stacking him up with other<br />presidents. History, as you well know will only judge him in comparison with<br />his predecessors –even you sir, in the end, would make such a judgment. As a<br />matter of fact, you have –regarding him and Hillary. This however not wrong; it<br />is something that we all do! It is the only marker. I do believe that is part<br />of the point.<br /><br />With all due respect (as I understand you<br />to be wiser than I could ever be) on the issue of plight of blacks in America,<br />I wrote an article on http://whatsayu.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61:mr-president&catid=46:race-consciousness&Itemid=53,<br />and argued a case on the plight of blacks and its direct correlation with the<br />election of Obama. (I trust that you’ll click on the link and read further.)<br /><br />The point is that as blacks in the world,<br />we step into the game with negative credentials (not because of our own doing),<br />but simply because we are black. The global systems and its gatekeepers managed<br />to psychologically deplete the character of blacks; this, on the pretext<br />that blacks were of an inferior breed. This idea has since been impregnated in<br />the minds of many in this world -to include blacks themselves. It is an idea<br />that is commonly and subliminal thought of as "the stigma of<br />blackness"; whereas, ignorance, laziness, anger, violence, incompetence,<br />ugliness and many other stereo-typical social ills are directly associated with<br />those of the black race. This has been an idea -or strategy, that has literally<br />crippled a group of people for over 389 years. It is rightly what I call one of<br />the greatest psychological tyrannies in human history. Alas, this has been the<br />condition under which those of black heritage -to include those of mix racial<br />make-up- have existed. To this, we have our brethren of the colonial powers to<br />thank. <br /><br />This is what I understand to be the<br />plight of blacks, and if it is this that you speak of, I seriously doubt that<br />any of Obama’s programs or policies–or for that matter those of any other<br />presidents can really eradicate this systemic ill.<br /><br />On the contrary, I believe the point of<br />the historical event of November 4th, 2008, the election of Barack Obama, (a<br />man who is of the group described above) as the leader of the very nation that<br />has for nearly 400 years, stripped -with great success- all those that<br />look like him of any existentialism; indeed, will forever be one of the<br />greatest moment in the history of this nation and most importantly of the<br />world. It marks the great turning point where a<br />clear acknowledgement of the creed that is the bedrock in the birth<br />of this nation -" We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men<br />are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain<br />unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of<br />happiness". Furthermore, this event is a symbolic utterance that maybe the<br />idea of "the stigma of blackness" -that has been perpetuated since<br />those early days, 389 years ago- either no longer exists or was in fact untrue.<br />For such belief could not be true, yet elect one who is purported to epitomize<br />such characteristics to be the leader of that very system. This symbolic<br />utterance has its physical representation as the psychological impact to which<br />I believe to be the meaning of the election of Obama –even if he is unable to<br />specifically address all individual concerns.<br /><br /><br /> </div>

  	<div class='Fulltext'><br />Mossa---YOU DO NOT get<br />the point it has nothing to do with what kind of JOB he can do. MY entire point<br />is that he can do NOTHING to help the plight of blacks and he will do more harm<br />than good for US. How he stacks up against other presidents is not an issue with<br />me. How is it up to me to give him a chance he has his chance unfortunately for<br />us he cannot help. he was not my second choice--he was my last choice on the DEM<br />side and I am 100% DEM. I know of no GOP that I could vote for and that includes<br />Colin Powell.<br /></div>

  	<div class='Fulltext'>I do get your point and argument against<br />Obama. I also understand that growing to appreciate someone who was not your<br />first choice in the beginning is an arduous task.  <br /><br />Following the political debate, I<br />understand the Administration’s argument to be contrary to “we inherited the<br />problems”, but the reality is that the existing Herculean task where the making<br />of the previous administration. These were issues that took nearly a decade to<br />manifest. Is it realistic to expect a change in one year? The argument that we<br />were promised change and yet things are business as usual is non-sense.<br /><br />Part of the major uproar against the<br />Administration is precisely because of the changes adapted or being adapted<br />–major financial regulations, health care, the stimulus, the stance on world<br />affairs, energy and many others.<br /><br />In truth, the nation is perpetually<br />divided. It is an impossible mission to introduce policies or reforms that<br />everyone will be fine with; as such, I understand your argument. But I believe,<br />at best, things will be fine– or at worst, I seriously doubt that Obama can<br />perform any worst than his predecessor. This much I think we can agree. Let us<br />give the man a chance! <br /><br /><br /> </div>
