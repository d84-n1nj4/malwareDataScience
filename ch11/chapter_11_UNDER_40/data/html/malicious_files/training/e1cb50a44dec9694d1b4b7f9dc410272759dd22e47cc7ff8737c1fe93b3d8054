			<p>After extensive conversation, soul searching and asking those important in my life, I have decided to submit my application for Trustee Aiazzi&#8217;s upcoming vacant board seat. On every level the circumstances are sad; beginning with disonance among the superintendent and trustees, our communities discontent and the ultimate price &#8211; interference with the work of educating our children. Parents, teachers, administrators and our students will weather this storm, but as with every driving storm, there will be some cleanup that remains. Here&#8217;s wishing all of us clear thinking, kind hearts &amp; calm seas ahead.</p>

			<p>THE ROLE OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT TRUSTEE</p>
<p>A WCSD Trustee must behave in an ethical and principled manner.  A Trustee must attend as many school “events” as humanly possible in order to gain a holistic understanding of the system and how it works.  The Trustee role includes using sound communication skills as well as being an effective listener.  I think it is important in the role of Trustee to help the community to understand the district’s mission, especially if support is to be garnered.  Ultimately the role of each Trustee is to be a responsible steward for the taxpayer dollars.  In essence, the role of a Trustee is one of student, teacher, partner and watchdog.</p>
<p>SIGNIFICANT REFORMS WITHIN THE DISTRICT AS PART OF ITS STRATEGIC PLAN</p>
<p><em>Envision WCSD 2015-Investing In Our Future</em>, is the WCSD’s current business plan.  The five strategic goals are well-written and comprehensive.  Each goal has well-developed objectives and measures.  The 2014-<em>2015 school year</em> is here.  We must fully assess our business plan, through the lens of student success as well as that of each and every adult&#8217;s success.  We need to focus our attention on what worked and what did not work, what we did and what we did not do so that we can work on the next generation of startegic planning.  The ultimate question is: has anything improved for our students educational future?  As a business woman and educator I recognize that it is time to work on phase 2 of <em>Envision</em>.  Re-Envison The Future!</p>
<p>AS A WCSD VOLUNTEER AND COLLEGE EDUCATOR I AM COMMITTED TO SUCCESS FOR EACH AND EVERY STUDENT.  Following are my ideas for improvement:</p>
<p><em><strong>4-IMPERATIVES</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>FIRST</strong> &#8211; Soon we will enter the 2015 Legislative Session.  Aside from securing new funding sources, we as a community collective must, side-by-side, show what we are willing to do to continue improving our educational opportunities for each and every student.  Washoe County businesses and other organizations working together can provide expertise and as well as a multitude of resources toward the continued development of college and career ready pathways.  Hundreds will accomplish what a few individuals struggle to do.</p>
<p><em> </em><strong>SECOND</strong> &#8211; Continue the discussions of STEM curriculum in order to move forward the understanding of developing and designing approaches for incorporating STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) into all course contents as well as school sponsored and teacher led student activities.  Every student activity as an academic endeavor.   The important idea is to include aspects of science, technology, engineering and math everywhere students read, write, draw, speak, run, dance, cook, jump, throw, kick, sing, listen………… learn.</p>
<p>Incorporating STEM into all aspects of learning, at all levels, has spurred district teachers and local University and Community College professionals to design innovative and feasible stratgies of working together toward a common goal of student success for college and career readiness.  Curricular programming and teacher education has brought together educational leaders and practicioners in such an effort.  The design and implementation has been a collective and systematic endeavor.  Wherever our students are, whether in the classroom, the playing field, the gym, the theater or the lunch room, we must take every opportunity to provide each child with an education that will build and sustain their future.  Ultimately we are accountable for the education of every student.  Everyone’s future depends upon our ability as a society to guide each child in meeting the challenges of a well-lived life, right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Research, collaboration, innovation and time are necessary for success.  Ultimately, we are responsible for educating informed voters who will be able to continue the practice of paying taxes and improving the community in which they live.</p>
<p><em>Two more to go……</em></p>
<p><strong>THIRD</strong> – Continue working hand-in-hand with business.  When business leaders take on the role of engaged expert and willing partner students and the community benefit.  Everything we hold near and dear and worth knowing have emerged from heart-felt and well-developed business ventures; we know what works and what does not work.  Whether sowing seeds or building airplanes, men and women create and implement the dreams.  We also know that we continue to discover what works.  Whether scientific research, business innovation, reflective introspection and/or testing and development, our educational system is predicated on educating and training an informed, responsible and voting populous.  Education and business working together, on all levels, is a key element in today’s innovative ventures.</p>
<p>“Working Hand-in-Hand,” is powerful.  Everyone in our community benefits from a strong educational system that aligns with business, higher education and local agencies.  We need to rethink the notion that the schools educate our children; communities educate our children.  Business’ wanting to locate into our area will be enticed by a community working hand-in-hand to design the future through integrated systems.  Monies via the Nevada Plan for guaranteed per pupil funding needs a thorough review.  As with any budget plan, circumstances arise that warrant changes.  A method for mitigating the “moving target” of budget planning is to have several plans waiting in the wings that are ready to respond to unique and unforeseen circumstances.  Designing and developing a school district budget that encompasses 63,000 students and 6400 employees with 103 schools is the responsibility of the WCSD-Superintendent and the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p><strong>FOURTH</strong> – Focus on academic endeavors that encompass several variables in order to ensure a world class education with limited funds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design and implement student success strategies – use what we have – our teachers are the most valuable resource</li>
<li>Hire and train highly effective teachers – continue to develop a community of learners who educate our students for the future</li>
<li>Understand and address workforce trends – college or career ready – education is a life-long-venture</li>
<li>Actively implement direct parent involvement activities – parents are a child’s first and ALWAYS teacher</li>
<li>Develop and engage community collaborations that support STEM – community experts working with teachers on a systematic plan</li>
</ol>
<p>Teaching the basics of literacy, math, science, technology, along with critical thinking and teamwork must drive our academics, budget planning and implementation.  We have to stay a course that deeply engages our students, families, employees and our community in order to educate children for the future.  There are no frills, especially if students are learning, engaged and enjoying the work; we are in tough economic times and we cannot do it all.  All learning activities must align with the mission.  We will need to make difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Together we can do anything!    -dr di</p>

			<p>Whether we call it &#8220;critical thinking,&#8221; &#8220;thinking for themselves,&#8221; &#8220;problem solving,&#8221; or many other phrases, academic rigor is basically helping children work through problems to find solutions.  Academic rigor in our educational systems has four basic elements:</p>
<p>1)  Students figure out how to <strong>create</strong> meaning out of what they learn,</p>
<p>2)  Students <strong>organize</strong> information so that they have mental models that represent what they know,</p>
<p>3)  Students <strong>integrate</strong> their skills into whole sets of processes, and</p>
<p>4)  Students<strong> apply</strong> what they have learned to new and practical situations.</p>
<p>These four elements will be important guides in how colleges, universities, and public school systems educate and train teachers and administrators.  With the unveiling of State/National Common Core Standards, now more than ever our &#8220;Academic Rigor&#8221; for teaching children and adult learners begins to take on a &#8220;what is good for them is good for us&#8221; agenda.</p>

			<p>WCSD is part of a nation-wide initiative led by the national Governors Association Center for best Practices and the Council of Chief State school officers.  Teachers, school administrators and experts have been developing this body of work for over 5 years.  This collaborative work provides a clear and consistent framework to prepare our children for college and the workforce.  The standards are informed by effective models from states across the country and reflects a common understanding of what is expected of students.  These expectations are the outline for teachers, parents and communities in an effort to align strategies, opportunities and funding in order to support student success.  The standards define the knowledge and skills students should have within their K-12 educational experience.  The Common Core State Standards define the rigorous skills and knowledge in English Language Arts and Mathematics.  These skills and knowledge need to be effectively taught and learned for students to be ready to succeed academically in credit-bearing, college-entry courses and in the workforce training programs.</p>

			<p>For many of us, Career &amp; Technical Education (CTE) is commonly known as Vocational Education (VE) or Occupational Education (OE).  As with any form of educational studies CTE, VE, OE have evolved through the ages.  Do you remember VE or OE as something kiddos did because they needed &#8220;special help?&#8221;  What I want you to know is that CTE in Washoe County School District (WCSD) is not an alternative form of public education for students who are educationally challenged; in fact the opposite can be said.  Do you know that the current graduation rate in WCSD for &#8220;typical&#8221; students is 74% and the graduation rate for CTE students is 84% &#8211; UUhhmmm, how can that be?  May I please provide 2- of the many reasons for the difference?  Kiddos need &#8220;hands-on&#8221; and &#8220;real-life&#8221; experiences.  To summarize, a Career and Technical Education course of study provides both elements plus, highly-qualified teachers, state-of-the-art materials and equipment, plus for many students a compelling reason for returning to their school each and every day.  WOW, might there be an additional element of FUN!</p>

			<p>If you have not read the Washoe County School District strategic plan I highly recommend that you spend time doing so.  <em>Envision WCSD 2015: Investing In Our Future </em>is a comprehensive outline for the future of our children.  An integral part of the plan is a college and career-ready pathway.  I wonder what led to the circumstances that precipitated a decrease in the numbers of students graduating from high school.  Was it mom&#8217;s entering the workforce or homes without fathers, was it grandparents no longer living in the home as part of the extended family or was it simply a natural progression in our disconnect with the classroom environment?  No matter the cause, it is imperative that our public school students complete their course of study via graduation from high school.  Whether moving onto to a sustainable form of employment, entering higher education, joining the military or peace corp, dropping out of high school is not a viable option for future success.  We must ensure that college and career-ready means more than just graduating; graduating to what must also be addressed.</p>
