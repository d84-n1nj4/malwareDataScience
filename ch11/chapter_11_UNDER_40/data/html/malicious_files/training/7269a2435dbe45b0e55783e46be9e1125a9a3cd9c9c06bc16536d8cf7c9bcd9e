					<p>It&#8217;s 2am and all I can do is think about you. Lately you have really been on my mind. Almost every hour. Are you trying to tell me something? I have been crying for an hour now. My heart hurts. It hurts so bad. I miss you so much.  I was looking through some pictures of you and wow you had such an amazing smile. I remember your laugh and your huges. I miss you so much. Alura got to go to the children&#8217;s hospital on friday and she of course remembers you and misses you too. Alondrea is still trying to run away from the hurt, but she is slowly getting it together. Grandma talks about you everyday.  I love you Well sweetheart I really need to go to bed I have to work at 7am and I have to get your sister ready. She is just like you. </p>

					<p>Wow I can&#8217;t believe it has been a year and 4 month&#8217;s since we lost you. I think about you everyday. I miss you so much. I have been trying so hard to move forward, but somedays I feel as if I have take a thousand steps back. I have been looking for ways to fill the void in my heart and nothing seems to work. First it was food and wow I have gained some weight. Then it was sleepless nights. Then I was working as much as I could, but then that took a huge toll on me. Now it&#8217;s just time to face the fact that nothing is going to replace you. I miss you so much. So does Alondrea, Alura and grandma. Alondrea is trying her hardest to just run from each situation. She just doesn&#8217;t want to face the fact that your gone. Alura well I catch her every now and then talking to you. She is still asking questions. Grandma talks about you everyday. She always talks about how funny you were. Last night I was thinking about my hopes and dreams and goals. I really want to be a great example for you and your sisters. I really want to do positive work and focus on Alyah&#8217;s Journey. IÂ just don&#8217;t know how to begin. I love you tell papa and uncle Shawn hello.</p>
<p>love you always Mommy</p>

					<p>Today I decided to read Alyah&#8217;s guest book on CB. It really made me smile to hear from you all. I thought it was going to be so hard but it was nice really nice.</p>
<div>I knew in my heart that this month would be hard because this month &#8220;October&#8221; is the month we started treatment for Alyahs bone marrow transplant. I have been kinda snappy to people and extra sensitive. I have thrown myself into work some I just don&#8217;t think to long about it. I had to stop and except it. Woo I know I have to take one day at a time. I am doing that.</div>
<div>I will do my best to do good. To help someone else. Alyah has touched so many lives especially mine. I want her to be looking down from heaven proud of me.</div>
<div>We are collecting pop tops from soda cans to donate to the Ronald McDonald House. I challenge all of you to do the same and donate them to your local RMH in Alyahs honor. If you decide to take this challenge please take pictures and post them on Facebook/Phaedra Haynes or email me at phae44@hotmail.com. God bless you all.</div>

					<p>May days and nights I think about Alyah. I also think of all the family&#8217;s that have gone through the same thing. It&#8217;s really hard to hear of another child passing. We had the chance to meet so many families while Alyah was on her journey. We keep up with all of there updates. To see these kids fighting so hard for their lives is heart breaking. I am asking that you take a moment out of your busy day and say a simple prayer on their behalf. Also for their family&#8217;s. Before you start your prayer look around and see what God has done for you. Thank him we take for granted we can breath on our own. We take for granted that we have a home to go to after work and cook and enjoy dinner with our loved ones. We take for granted that we are able to pay bills. I know this may seem like a lot but so many family&#8217;s are all in one hospital room. Some can only have one family member in at a time. We stress about paying bills and they stress about if they will have enough money for dinner. Please take a minute and think about how you are living and how you might be able to help someone else out. Sometimes just taking snacks to your local hospital or taking them some reading material. Collect the pop tabs for your local RMH. The one thing everyone can do is PRAY! Please think about it. God bless you all have a blessed night. In loving memory of Alyah. She was someone who loved everyone.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 13px">So many nights I lay and look up and think of Alyah. Sometimes I smile most of the time I cry. I am ok during the day when I can throw myself into work, but at night it gets really hard. This kind of pain hurts so deep and so bad you can&#8217;t explain it. I hear people all the time telling me how sorry they are and it&#8217;s nice but it still hurts so bad. I miss her so much. I had to pack up the house this week and I found pictures of her as a baby. Then some when she went to camp. She was so happy. She was such a happy child and so smart. I would give anything just to have her back. Alura still has her moments when she just cry&#8217;s and says I want Alyah mommy. I miss her and my heart just breaks.<br />
Alyah&#8217;s teacher contacted me this week and they are collect pop tops for the month of Oct in Alyah&#8217;s honor. That made me really happy. She is still in everyone&#8217;s heart. Please continue to pray for us. We might appear to look good on the outside, but we are still hurting on the inside. Thank you all and God bless you.</span></p>

<p>Back to school. Tomorrow will be Alura&#8217;s first day of school. Tomorrow will also be the day that some of Alyah&#8217;s old classmates will find out that she passed away. My heart goes out to all the teachers that will have to share that news with those children. They loved Alyah and they wanted her to get better. I just pray that these children realize how blessed they are just to be able to go to school. That is all Alyah ever wanted to do. She loved school. She loved her teachers. She was so smart. The one thing I can say is I see so much of Alyah in Alura. Alura also loves school and loves to learn. While I am missing one child I am happy for another one. I am also proud of my oldest one she is working and also getting ready to go to college. I have been blessed with wonderful children. All Alyah wanted to do is go to school. When someone start to complain because they have to go to school or they have to much school work you can share with them how you knew a little girl and all she wanted to do is go to school. Be Blessed</p></div>

					<p>What a day. This is my second week back at work and it is going better then what I thought. Today was a little rough. Today one of my customers came up to me and said &#8220;Oh your back how are you? How is Alyah?&#8221; I looked to him and said I am doing fine but Alyah passed away. He looked at me in shock and said I am so sorry. He then hugged me. No I didn&#8217;t break down but I must say it was hard. He asked me what can I do and I said pray for me. God works in amazing ways. When we first learned that Alyah needed a bone marrow transplant everyone would ask what they could do for us and I would say pray for us. Now that she is gone people want to know what they can do well they can continue to pray. When you don&#8217;t know what to do and you don&#8217;t know what to say &#8221; JUST PRAY&#8221; God is listening and he is a healer.</p>
<p>I am giving you a gift of peace of mind and heart. The peace I give is a gift the world cannot give so don&#8217;t be troubled or afraid. John 14:27</p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Good morning. Yesterday was my first day back to work. I was a little nervous but it went well. All the hugs and smiles was just what I needed. I know I walked all over that store I hope I will just a few pounds. Even the customers were great. Thank you Lord. Everyday gets a little better but I miss Alyah so much but I know she is with me. Alyahs journey fight Fanconi anemia page on Facebook is giving out great information and I even have people messaging me about information on how to join the bone marrow registry. They also have been asking questions on how to care for BMT patient. This is great. This is the reason Alyah&#8217;s Journey will continue. What a blessing to know that she is still helping to save lives. God is so good.Â </span></span></p>
