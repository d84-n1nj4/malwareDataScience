            Stylish baseball cleats vs. soccer cleats,<a href="http://mojs.se/email/chaussure-de-foot-adidas-f50-i-tunit-20748fs.html">chaussure de foot adidas f50 i tunit</a> Fit, Comfort and Break In<p>The Hummel Old School DK fits longer than most other brands so if you order a pair definitely go half a size down, you may even get away with going a full size down as I would compare the fit in length to the Adidas Copa Mundial.</p><p>In terms of width these actually surprised me and fit quite tight especially in the midfoot area, not too tight by any means but they have more of a snug fit than many heritage releases that I have worn.</p><p>The break in period was relatively smooth with only point that caused a slight irritation where the leather creased and made a small cut on my big toe of my left foot. This only happened during my first training session wearing them and disappeared after about 90 minutes of use.</p><p>The overall comfort is very decent, I wouldn't say they were the most comfortable boots I've worn but are not bad either, the Kangaroo leather used in the forefoot is good quality and offers a nice cushioned feel but the synthetic material used is the midfoot is quite rigid and stiff.</p><p></p>Touch and Striking<p>The Hummel Old School DK I feel doesn't use enough leather as it only covers the forefoot where I prefer the majority of the instep to use the same material and the blend from leather to synthetic is drastic, the leather is very soft and the synthetic is rigid which I felt caused an inconsistent feel when receiving the ball. This may be partly psychological but it definitely hampered my touch on the ball as I tried to adjust so when receiving the ball I was taking it on the leather part of the boots.</p><p>Striking the ball is what you would expect from a kangaroo leather boot with a very natural feeling strike, as you would expect from a heritage release there is no shooting technology.</p>Traction<p>The Hummel Old School DK uses a classic 12 moulded stud pattern with 4 studs at the rear and 8 at the front that are separated in to three sections with a trio of studs on the instep.</p><p>The soleplate is fairly stiff to start but loosens off nicely after a couple of wears and offers quite a responsive feeling, overall the traction done its job well on grass and also artificial grass.</p><p></p><p></p> <a href="http://brasherrealestate.com/pay/Botas-Copa-Mundial.asp">Femmes 2014 USA Soccer Jersey|Cheap USA Soccer Jerseys|US Soccer Apparel</a> <b>baseball cleats vs. soccer cleats</b> <p>Nike use a printed graphic overlay that is easily one of the most identifiable boots ever released. It is actually the digital print of the Star Vela Supernova and it includes a unique seven star path print, paying homage to Cristiano's jersey number. Finding the seven star path is actually pretty tough as I counted more than 7 large stars, I'm sure there is a trick to this one and maybe some of you astronomers can provide more insight!</p><p>To add some additional pop, Nike has added a chrome swoosh flecked with silver fleck and a Blue Glow outline. I'm a fan of the Swoosh design as it is vibrant and very different to any other style Nike has used in the past.</p><p>Inside the 6.6oz boot, Nike make sure to remind us who these boots are intended for &#8220;<em>Created to the exact specifications of Cristiano Ronaldo</em>&#8220;. It is a tidy touch and one that provides a more personal touch. They also add a signature CR7 hit on the heel to ensure fellow players are not under the illusion these boots have been created just for you!</p><p></p><p></p>
