<p>
	She goes still and slightly white. Her teeth bite into her lip and she looks at the curtains. &ldquo;What is it you think I took from you?&rdquo; Her voice is thin, almost inaudible.</p>
<p>
	I go on full alert. Her reaction is muted now, but I can&rsquo;t help but think of the way she freaked out in Chiang Mai. She&rsquo;s definitely done something she&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;ll find out about.</p>
<p>
	Unease knots my gut.</p>
<p>
	Focus on what I want first. If I get that, I&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to figure it out.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Half a year,&rdquo; I state firmly.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She turns toward me, dropping her hands in her lap. &ldquo;How did I steal half a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No. I want half a year. With you. Twenty-four weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And just exactly how did you arrive at that number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A week for each month you stayed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She snorts. &ldquo;Perhaps you should ask your brother to stay with you for twenty-four weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This again. Now I&rsquo;m glad I had that call. &ldquo;I already spoke with Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Her eyes are sharper now. &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He said he didn&rsquo;t do anything to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Chapter Ten</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Ava</p>
<p>
	I glare at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I trust him. It&rsquo;s not his style to interfere in relationships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Of course! Why would you ever doubt your awesome brother? Let&rsquo;s doubt the gold digger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Lucas inhales sharply. &ldquo;I never considered you a gold digger. You know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Right. That&rsquo;s why you kept showering me with money and gifts&hellip;and a freaking Lexus. Because I&rsquo;m not a gold digger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I gave you those things because I wanted to help. And you needed a new car anyway. That rattrap you were driving was a time bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	My mouth twists at the familiar argument. The beat-up, dilapidated Nissan, as far as Lucas was concerned, was going to give out on some deserted road frequented only by serial killers and rapists. I give a sudden and theatrical mock-gasp, as though I just recalled something, and cover my mouth with a hand. &ldquo;Oh, and I forgot. I&rsquo;m also supposed to be your mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And a dumb one too from the way liquid heat lingers in my veins. God. How can I still respond to Lucas like that? My body should know better.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Ava,&rdquo; he growls out my name in a warning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never said you were a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The old mortification surges, and I feel my cheeks and chest heat. &ldquo;Not to my face, you didn&rsquo;t. So what? You think saying that crap behind my back makes it better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	His mouth parts. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;  </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t talk about me as a mistake or a gold digger, why did your brother call me those things the moment we met? How did he get that impression?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I already told you I spoke with him, and he said he doesn&rsquo;t remember saying anything of the sort. You&rsquo;re mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I stare at him. He&rsquo;s so, so earnest, his gaze direct and steady. This is how he was able to get me to succumb to him in the first place. I couldn&rsquo;t turn him down when he looked at me like that, like he meant every syllable.</p>
<p>
	So why did Blake say those things? Did he really deny everything to Lucas?</p>
<p>
	I feel like my world is upending again, my resolve weakening. The truths I knew are no longer true, and I only want to believe what Lucas is telling me.</p>
<p>
	Don&rsquo;t be an idiot.</p>
<p>
	Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice&hellip;</p>
<p>
	I can&rsquo;t afford to repeat the past. I drop my eyes. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The hell you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	A knock interrupts him. He curses under his breath and answers the door. It&rsquo;s room service.</p>
<p>
	The man keeps his gaze straight ahead and brings our food in. If he senses the tension in the suite, he doesn&rsquo;t show it. He lays everything out, confirms that the order is correct, has Lucas sign a slip and disappears.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; Lucas says, retaking his sectional.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I told you, I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Humor me, Ava.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The cold, quiet rasp of his voice lets me know he&rsquo;s close to his breaking point. I grab a fry and nibble on it, while he helps himself to the steak. If he&rsquo;s disappointed by how small the portion sizes are, he doesn&rsquo;t show it. Japanese people consume not even a third of what Americans routinely polish off in one sitting.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;As I said, I want you back for twenty-four weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If you need a fuck buddy, surely you can get Faye Belbin to fill the role,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>
	A tinge of something that looks like satisfaction glitters in his gaze. &ldquo;Jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I told you, I didn&rsquo;t sleep with her while I was with you. She and I were over years ago. Ask her to confirm if that will help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I laugh. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been listening to anything, have you? I don&rsquo;t trust you. I don&rsquo;t trust the people around you to tell the truth, Blake being the most recent example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I trusted you.&rdquo; He speaks quietly and evenly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to Osaka to fight, Ava. And I can&rsquo;t stay in Japan for long, so you&rsquo;ll have to quit your job and come back home with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Both my eyebrows rise. &ldquo;Are you out of your freaking mind? There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m quitting my job for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Teaching isn&rsquo;t your calling. You told me you wanted to be a writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Teaching is what I do so I can eat and put a roof over my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I can give you money, enable you to write full-time. Surely you can write a book in twenty-four weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I have to laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not quite that sim&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Fine, whatever, it takes longer. I&rsquo;ll continue to provide for you until you make enough to earn a living from your writing. How long does it take to write a book? A year? Two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bastard. He&rsquo;s using what I told him in a moment of particular closeness to leverage me.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the girl I used to be, and people&rsquo;s dreams change. I&rsquo;m not going back to you. I can never go back to what we had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He frowns. &ldquo;What was so objectionable about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	My mouth slackens. &ldquo;What wasn&rsquo;t objectionable about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What we had was perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;For you, maybe, because it was on your terms. It was about you fucking me whenever you wanted.&rdquo;
