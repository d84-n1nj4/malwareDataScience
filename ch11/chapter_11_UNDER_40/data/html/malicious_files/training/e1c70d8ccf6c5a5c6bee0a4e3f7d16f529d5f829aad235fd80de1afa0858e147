365.worldsoccershop looks at how the brands are scoring in Brazil. The brands on the goals score sheet are adidas, Mizuno, Nike, Puma, and Under Armour. Take a look at the number of goals each brand. And make sure to check out which players are at the top of FIFA World Cup Golden Boot Table. Apart from the Magista Obra Nike have released three other lower tier Magista boots, all of which cater to a certain type of player. To help make your decision a little bit easier here is a quick rundown of what you need to know about all four models. Nike Magista Obra The Nike Magista Obra is the top tier Magista boot and therefore will naturally set you back the most. FlyKnit is the biggest feature that sets the Obra apart from the rest of the Magista line, as none of the other boots feature it. FlyKnit is the boot’s knitted upper and is meant to provide a second-skin feel and in turn a better touch. Another feature reserved only for the Obra is the mid-cut Dynamic Fit Collar that extends to the top of the ankle. The collar locks down the wearers fit and creates a more secure, snug fit. Nike Magista Opus .

If you missed it, which I think ?lot of you did, WorldSoccerShop released a limited edition boot in collaboration with?World-renowned shoe artist Kickasso.?These limited edition custom St. Patrick's Day Nike Mercurial Superfly boots featured plenty of celtic styling through the upper in a green graphic. From images, you can see how spiral symbols have been added that represent energy and unity. It is a very expressionist piece that highlights the same art you'd find on high crosses and relics right through the Irish countryside. <b>ny adidas predator</b> ,<b>ny adidas predator</b>,
Warrior BrandingI'm already really well associated with the Warrior brand and I like how they brand each of their releases. Again, you get the large W on the outer side of the boot, but is the boots name that sits on the instep that really works well. It can be difficult to include the silo name on the boot and not many companies even attempt it, but Warrior has somehow managed t0 pull it off! <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/566046246893573938/">Nike Mercurial Vapor X AG CR7 Exclusive White Safari $60.57</a>

So, what is the Puma evoSPEED 1 all about?Weighing in at 6.3oz, the evoSpeed 1 is all about speed and acceleration, The upper is made of a thin monolayer microfiber upper that features a dot-pattern along the forefoot for added control benefits, while stability is provided by the internal EverFit cage. The anatomically engineered lightweight one-piece outsole provides stability and support, utilizing high-tech materials to minimize weight and to maximize its flexibility and reactivity.
