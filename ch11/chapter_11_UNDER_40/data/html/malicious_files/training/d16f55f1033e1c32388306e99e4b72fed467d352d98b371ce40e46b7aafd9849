It also lowers the stress levels, which has got to be good! Over the years I have seen thousands of jokes, which just make you laugh – then you see how it can be applied to your business.<br /><br />Below are a selection of the stories that have been collected over the years and a big thank you to all those anonymous people who have dreamt those ups and shared them around the world.<br /><br /><br />“I pretend to work – they pretend to pay me.” </span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 fi ">Anonymous<br /></span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 "><br />“I aim to please one person a day.

<br /><br /><br /></span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 fb ">2011 The Eurozone Joke<br /></span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 ">
<br />Removed from the EU headquarters in Brussels, here is a copy of the latest press release from the European Commission, which they would rather you did not see.<br /><br />I sorry that should have read, “2011 Eurozone Jokes.” Well as we fondly look back to 2011 in between the Japanese </span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 fi ">Tsunami </span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 ">and the Arab Spring, there were the painful/hilarious/unbelievable (delete the descriptions which don’t match) attempts by European leaders to patch up … sorry that should be … the re-launching and re-branding of the marvellous European currency that was promised would bring Europe closer together and make life cheaper for those hard working band of cheerful Europeans.<br />As we all wake up with in 2012 with the mother of all headaches, after our attempt to blot out the all those financial problems, by attempting to consume the over production of European wine and beer, we know that 2012 will ultimately and invariably be worse than 2011. So to cheer us all up with the help of Rebecca Burn-Callander of influential “Management Today” magazine, here are the top Eurozone jokes of 2011.<br /><br />1) A Greek, an Irishman and a Portuguese go into a bar and order a drink. Who picks up the bill? A - German.<br /><br />2) The Eurozone credit ratings are like a frying pan.Greece at the bottom...<br /><br />3) Oh dear. The Eurozone's Facebook page has changed its currency status from ‘single’ to ‘it's complicated’.<br /><br />4) NEWS FLASH: Greece has approached the IMF for a €60bn loan after they were turned down by Wonga<br /><br />5) The Eurozone leaders are looking for a stimulus package. Silvio Berlusconi suggested two Viagra and a Red Bull.<br /><br />6) My wife misunderstood my son when he asked for some Play-Doh for Christmas. She got him a load of euros.<br /><br />7) Q: How do you know it's going to be a double-dip recession?A: Greek exports of taramosalata and tzatziki have plunged.<br /><br /> 8) Some years ago a small rural town in Spain twinned with a similar town in Greece.The mayor of the Greek town visited the Spanish town. When he saw the palatial mansion belonging to the Spanish mayor, he wondered aloud how on earth he could afford such a house.The Spaniard replied: ‘You see that bridge over there? The EU gave us a grant to construct a two-lane bridge, but by building a single lane bridge with traffic lights at either end, I could build this place.’The following year the Spaniard visited the Greek town. He was simply amazed at the Greek mayor's house: - gold taps, marble floors, diamond doorknobs, it was marvellous.When he asked how he’d raised the money to build this incredible house, the Greek mayor said: ‘You see that bridge over there?’The Spaniard replied: ‘No.'<br /><br />9) In heaven: -<br />the cooks are French,<br />the policemen are English,<br />the mechanics are German,<br />the bureaucrats are Irish,<br />the chocolate makers are Belgium,<br />the lovers are Italian,and the bankers are Swiss.<br /><br />In hell: -<br />the cooks are Belgium,<br />the policemen are German,<br />the mechanics are French,<br />the bureaucrats are English,<br />the chocolate makers are Irish,<br />the lovers are Swiss,<br />and the bankers are Italian.<br /><br />10) Breaking news: - The Eurozone financial crisis will soon be over as Greece has received an unconditional €100bn bailout offer.All they have to do is email their account details to the anonymous daughter of wealthy, but deceased African general...<br /><br />And finally…..<br /><br />Plans are well underway to solve the EU debt problem once and for all in 2012. In a surprise move the European Central bank is moving to Rome. An EU spokesman said, “It makes perfect sense to move it to Italy because there are so many similarities between the EU and the Italian economy. Organised crime is the biggest industry in Italy with a turnover of more than 140bn euro (£116bn) a year. The figure is equivalent to 7% of the country's GDP, a huge amount of money to be passing from businesses straight into the pockets of gangsters without any tax entering the public purse.<br /><br />Extortion and intimidation is used to prise millions in protection money from shopkeepers, restaurants, cinemas, construction companies and thousands of other businesses, as the Godfathers spread their criminal enterprises across the entire country. As a result of the ongoing economic crisis the Mafia is also cashing in with its traditional money-raising methods of loan sharking as well - charging extortionate interest rates to hard-pressed businesses which are unable to raise funds.<br /><br />We feel that Italy processes the right kind of skill sets that the EU can take advantage of. For example, the EU is run by unaccountable bureaucrats, Italy by the Godfathers. The EU ignores normal financial controls such as audits, the Mafia ignore paying taxes. The EU extorts taxes from EU citizens and the Cosa Nostra does much the same thing with businesses. The EU is extremely good at making money disappear on large social infrastructure projects and the Mafiosi do exactly the same thing but it is called, ‘money-laundering.’<br /><br />We believe that if we can harness Italian technical banking and financial skills for managing the Eurozone, we will provide a permanent solution to the current economic crisis. There will no longer be a potential fragmentation of the Euro; instead during 2012 we see more countries such as Britain joining the Euro.”<br /><br />Reporters then requested comments about the plans from the two main Euro architects, France’s president Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel. Another EU spokesperson stated that they were unavailable as they were locked together in a private chateau or schloss depending on which side you belong to, negotiating a double entendre which, can roughly be translated as an, ‘interesting weekend.’<br /><br />Later a shagged out … I’m sorry... I meant to say… ‘a tired’ President Sarkozy emerged to say, “Merde! Us French have always had a gift of being able to have shady affairs. Just look at my predecessors, Jacques Chirac, François Mitterrand and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.”<br /><br />Reaction to the news on the European stock exchanges was as follows: - the German DAX rose by 5%, the Borsa Italiana  rose by 10% and the French CAC 40 rose by 20% on the basis that it was a chance to get rich quick. In subsequent news the FT fell by 50% on hearing the announcement, whilst the Irish Stock Exchange rose by an incredible 200% believing that another era of ‘free money’ had arrived.<br /><br />Sampling the reaction to the news on the streets of London, an investment banker stated said that, “this is good for Britain and even better for the financial industry as there is even more chance to gain a dishonest profit.” An English worker, who wished to remain anonymous, for fear that HMRC would identify him and screw more tax out of him, shrugged in disbelief and asked where the nearest pub was so that he could get pissed. <br /></span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 fb ">
<br />Economics Is Easy To Understand – Just Use Cows<br /><br /></span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 ">For years economists have baffled people with graphs about demand and supply, and economic terms such as balance of payments, devaluation, reserve currencies and the Gold Standard.

<br /><br />Five surgeons are discussing who the best patients to operate on were.<br /><br />The first surgeon says, 'I like to see accountants on my operating table because when you open them up, everything inside is numbered.’<br /><br />The second responds, 'Yeah, but you should try electricians! Everything inside them is colour-coded.’<br /><br />The third surgeon says, 'No, I really think librarians are the best; everything inside them is in alphabetical order.'<br /><br />The fourth surgeon chimes in, 'You know I like construction workers. Those guys always understand when you have a few parts left over at the end, and when the job takes longer than you said it would.'<br /><br />But the fifth surgeon shut them all up when he observed, 'You're all wrong. Politicians are the easiest to operate on. There are no guts, no heart, no balls, no brains, and no spine, and there are only two moving parts - the mouth and the arsehole - and they are interchangeable.'<br /><br /></span><span class="ff2 fc0 fs12 fb ">
