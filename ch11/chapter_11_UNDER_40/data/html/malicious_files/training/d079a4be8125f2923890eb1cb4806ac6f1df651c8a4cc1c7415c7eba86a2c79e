        <p>Well, a lot has changed. I am still trying every day to come to grips with my mom not being here. I think she visits Austin, sometimes he sits and talks to someone in his room, or blows kisses.  He knows who his Nonni is. I need to make him a photo album, but we do have pictures of her all over. Austin is talking so  much, more and more every day. He amazes me daily. We are truly lucky, no allergies, good eater, good sleeper, overall happy little man. He has his &#8220;two-year old&#8221; moments, but he is a good kid. I don&#8217;t know if i would have made it through the last 2 and a half years without him. He is my sunshine as much as he makes me crazy. Things with Brandon are okay.  I know I don&#8217;t have a lot of room to complain. I am very lucky, but just content. That&#8217;s as much as I will elaborate. Michael doesn&#8217;t come around, and I don&#8217;t make the effort either, but I have a two-year old. A lot of people have come to show their true colors and who are really my friends. Became friends with one of the yoga instructors, that also became trainer and nutritionist, and pointed me in the direction to achieve my goal for the year in 3 months and lose 13 pounds since January. Another surprising friendship has come from my cousins ex girlfriend. She is 20, but has a good head on her shoulders, and we have a lot in common despite being 12 years older.</p>
<p>All in all, I am very thankful for what I have. I miss what has been lost. And I am loved every day.</p>

        <p>It has been a long time since I think I have really felt anything other than sadness. I am beginning to think that when I lost you that I lost part of myself, and I don&#8217;t know how to get it back. Did I just go numb, and just now beginning to notice? Did my emotions shut down just to pull me through losing you? And if they did, how do I feel again? Other than sadness, anger and depression? Austin makes me happy. Nothing will ever change that. But everything else seems so, I don&#8217;t know, empty. I know I can&#8217;t handle more pain. Maybe that&#8217;s what happened. Maybe my heart is in a bubble, afraid to come out. Blocking everything from consuming me. Maybe everyone was right, maybe I really wasn&#8217;t okay, even though I felt like I was.</p>

        <p>Well it has been a long time since I have written, so much going on. I had a little boy, named Austin, he is almost 6 months old. He is a monkey, and is in constant motion. He is my strength, and my sunshine. Brandon and I have almost been married a year, July 11th. My mom was looking like she was winning the fight with cancer, and things have taken an unexpected turn. Almost 2 weeks ago we found out the cancer has spread and is wrapping itself around my moms heart. All they can do at this point is make her as comfortable as possible. They don&#8217;t give her a year. She had a permanent drain put in to drain the fluid around her lungs, because it keeps accumulating, and very quickly. I am really trying to come to grips with the fact that I am going to lose my mother. But there is only so much you can do to prepare yourself. She has been my best friend. The baby is what keeps me going, keeps me focused. When she was diagnosed I made a deal with a friend of ours whose father also had lung cancer, that if she lost her dad and I lost my mom, we would move to Texas, where Brandon&#8217;s parents live, so that my child can have grandparents. A lot has happened since we made that deal. Her father did pass away. She doesn&#8217;t really talk to me anymore.  But between my moms cancer, and Austin, it has brought this family back together. I don&#8217;t want to leave everyone. I have been in contact with my father more, but it is when I reach out, and I fear that is the only way we will have a relationship. I am frustrated with it, but what can I do? So I am not supposed to keep it all bottled up, but I have to stay strong for Austin. He is too little to understand. I am going to look for a recordable story book, so I can have my mom read Austin a story forever. I am going to put together a photo album of pictures of my mom so that I can show him. I don&#8217;t want him to ever forget his Nonni. Austin has been her sunshine, her incentive to fight. I don&#8217;t know what I am going to do without my mother. All I can do now, is take care of my child, and make sure my mom knows that we love her.</p>

        <p>Well I am 7 weeks away from my due date. Time is flying by. Emotions are flying around, and things are getting harder to deal with. I am alone from Tuesday morning til Thursday night. And I am limited as to what I can do. So I am not only lonely, but bored. I am going to start crocheting the baby a blanket. We are going to be moving to New Jersey because of Brandon&#8217;s job, but not until after the baby comes. The plan is for me to stay home with the baby, instead of my paycheck going towards daycare. I have taken 3 classes already, and there is a lot of stuff to remember and to do. My baby shower is in 17 days. I think this pregnancy has also made me see who and what is important in my life. Sarah and I are no longer friends, and Corrine doesn&#8217;t ever talk to me, unless I go to her store. My best friends these days are Catie, Corrine, and Kristen. But they are all 45 minutes to an hour away. So it is hard on nights where Brandon is in a hotel and I am home alone. I try to do my best, but sometimes I just get sad. My mom has shown some improvement from her chemo. I am hoping that come December Brandon won&#8217;t have to stay in Jersey during the week. I am worried I will go into labor and he will be 2 hours away. Just scary to think of doing it alone.  So much to do, so much happening, hope there is enough time.</p>

        <p>There is so much going on now. I am almost 21 weeks pregnant. Showing pretty good by now. Everyone wants to rub my belly. Other than that, I am having a pretty easy pregnancy, knock on wood. The only thing I can say that I don&#8217;t have alot of control over is my emotions. They are not up and down to the point of serious mood swings. But things are making me more emotional, and making things that I need to be strong for, harder. Two of my best friends just broke up, and I went out and saw her with someone else, and it made me really sad. Sad to the point of crying in the bar. I have only known them together, and just hard not seeing them together anymore. The lack of relationship and parenting from my father has been getting to me. The fact that he has never really been apart of my life, and doesn&#8217;t seem to have interest in his grandchild. The biggest thing going on now, that is the hardest, is my mom just spent a week in the hospital and was diagnosed with lung cancer. I am trying so hard to be strong, and it is so difficult. She is gonna fight, she is gonna battle. She wants to be around for her grand baby. So the next four months, pretty much until I have the baby, she will be going through chemotherapy. I am hoping and praying that this takes care of it. I have lived most of my life without a father, I cannot picture my life without my mother. So the task now is to try to keep my emotions under control, for my sake, and the sake of the baby.</p>

        <p>Well it has been 2 months since I posted, and lots has happened since then. I am engaged, getting married hopefully next month, and I am pregnant. I am about 11 weeks or so. The baby is due January 1st, a New Years baby. A lot of changes are happening and going to continue to happen. I will be moving in with Brandon, hopefully in the next couple weeks. Trying to figure out bringing the cats together. Need to find a way to get the upstairs remodeling done, hopefully way before the baby comes. I have been out of work almost 5 months, and between pregnancy and not working have put on 20 pounds and feel like a fat ass, even though I know I&#8217;m not. I already have a belly, and I have never had a belly.  There are many girls I know, that are pregnant too, 3 of which are due the same time as me. One of them, I have actually been helping being a &#8220;mommys helper&#8221;. Figured it gave her help, and me some learning time with a baby. But I am struggling to find any other work, and it is hard, because in 5-6 months, I won&#8217;t be able to work. So the question is, do I bother to keep looking for a job, even though my unemployment is gonna run out in 4 months.</p>

        <p>About a month and a half ago, while Brandon was in Omaha for Thanksgiving, something came over me. An overall feeling of calm. I knew what I wanted and I was willing to make sacrifices to get it. I was less worried and more relaxed than ever before. It was a nice change. And over the last month and a half I have slipped up a couple times, and got worried and over analytical. But one of those times I was trying to quit smoking, so I didn&#8217;t feel like myself.  But I keep going back to being calm. Sometimes I just need a little help. Sometimes something as simple as a sweet phrase does the trick to snap me out of it. I have been making a conscious effort to remain this way, because one it is easier to live life this way, and two it is beneficial to my relationship. So I guess all I ask for continued help and support. I have been much happier and much calmer since this has come over me. And it has stemmed to other parts of my life. Things I have always needed, are much less needed. Everything has been much better and much easier. Now the trick is to remain this way, even when it is hard to do so.</p>

        <p>This year I am doing something I never do. I am going to be away from my family, and with Brandon and his family for Christmas.  We are driving to Houston, TX to spend the holiday with his family. I am really excited. I met his parents in May for Brandons birthday. But this is the first roadtrip since we have been back together. My mom is mad at me, but I am 28 years old, and I want to be with my boyfriend for the holiday. I was with family for Thanksgiving. I am excited, that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>

        <p>I was ready to give up on love. Ready to go thru life settling for things to get me by. My love has come back to me. When people see me, they say I am different, I am happy. I feel happy. I feel calm and relaxed. I feel blissful. I did something in my head, that kinda put everything in perspective. And I was afraid it was going to be a temporary change. But I think I really did change. Just relaxed and less worried about my relationship. I love him, and I know someday he will love me back. When he looks at me, its like he can see deep inside my soul. When he touches me, its like he reaches inside my chest and touches my heart.  It is just so wonderful, just laying in his arms. Going out and saying this is my boyfriend. He is so thoughtful and considerate and sweet. We kinda take care of each other. Thats what love is supposed to be. And I am just glad to have him back.</p>
