By Brian Jennings – Austrian Thomas Piermayr came to the Colorado Rapids as a trialist in 2014 but has proceeded to feature prominently in Head Coach Pablo Mastroeni’s plans.  First as a starter out wide in the defensive back line that was missing players early on this season he also serves as valuable depth in that unit.
Piermayr is happy to be contributing to a new-look Rapids team where he is also the lone MLS player plying his trade in Asics boots this season.  In a league dominated by German and Oregon-based boot manufacturers, Piermayr has found his fit in a company that is well known in running circles but not quite in the soccer world.
“I think in MLS I’m the only one,” says Piermayr, a veteran of top-division teams in Austria, Scotland, and Norway.  “For me, they fit good, they’re comfortable.  I like leather boots and that’s why I play with Asics. It’s a Kangaroo leather.”

As the lowest-tier boot, the Onda features a stock synthetic upper that Nike have dubbed ‘Trophy’. While the upper is still textured, the fit and touch will be a far cry from that offered even on the Orden.
As with the Orden the Onda features a TPU base and will come in AG and astroturf models.

            Loving football boots new zealand,<a href="http://blumes.se/en/football-boots-daily-mail-67094ud.html">football boots daily mail</a> The Netherlands are eager to add their name to the list of World Cup winners.  The Dutch are the best team to have never won the tournament with 3 runners-up finishes (1974, 1978, and 2010).
Are you are part of Nike F.C.?  Nike recently released their latest line of apparel for those who are willing to take risks.  ‘Sem Risco náo há Vitória (without risk there is no victory)’ is what it takes to be a champion.
Get in the Gear, Get in the Game.  The World Soccer Shop is the best place to get your authentic team gear and the gear to get you back out on the field.
The early fall is a great time of year for soccer fans.  The European domestic leagues are hitting full stride and the major brands are seemingly continuously rolling out new products.  The brands do their best to keep a tight lid on these releases but over eager players, who receive their pair before official launches, are sometimes guilty of spilling the beans.
Chelsea’s Under-21 star Charly Musonda is the latest culprit.  The 17-year-old, who has been compared to Eden Hazard, Andres Iniesta, Xavi, and others, was relaxing in the training room in what appears to be the new Nike Gold Vapor colorway.  This is rumored to  <a href="http://extremecustompcs.co.uk/Designed/Customize-Phone-Case.php">Htc Incredible Case Htc Inspire 4g Case Htc Desire Hd Cases</a> <b>football boots new zealand</b> <p><strong>Is it difficult to slip your feet into them?</strong></p><p>Actually not really. It does take some maneuvering, but that is at a minimum. The collar is decently wide and allows your foot to slip through without being overly constrictive. Where they are a little tricky is pulling them off!! No, seriously they are actually really tough to get back off your feet. This is related to the grippy inner lining that keeps your heel in place during play, which is actually a good thing as it means your foot is fully secure through play.</p>
