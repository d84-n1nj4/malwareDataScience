What makes them even more unique is the fact that each of the 100 Limited Edition pairs will feature its own unique newspaper print – there will be no duplicate boots. In order to create the final design, papermache is used and this means it is impossible to create the same visual appearance on two pairs. Newspaper featuring World Cup news stories will be used, although we are not sure what country the newspaper will come from (in other words will it be all English or will Portuguese text be used). From what we can tell, these boots feature all English. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/451485931371767232/">Nike Hypervenom Phelon TF Astroturf Charcoal Crimson Blk $61.00</a>

The adidas Hybridtouch synthetic leather first appeared on the Predator LZ. Although featured on the Predator LZ 1st and 2nd generations, it is hard to tell actual performance because of all the rubber zones until Adidas used it on the Nitrocharge 1.0. ?Hybridtouch is a super soft hybrid that provides the benefits of leather and durable synthetic (similar to Kanga-Lite). ?It has a very minimal break in time because it is soft and flexible. ?There is also a leather grain finish which helps make the visual appearance more realistic. ?According to adidas, Hybridtouch is 40% lighter than leather and maintains its shape for a longer time period. ?With benefits of leather and synthetic, Hybridtouch is one step closer to the end of leather.
