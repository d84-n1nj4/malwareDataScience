			<h1>Chairman’s Corner – Issue 10</h1>
<p>This is certainly turning out to be one of the busiest years ever for the CRA, as we tackle a number of important issues in our community. For a start, we’ve been highlighting the problems that we think Chellaston will face if uncontrolled development is allowed to take place, particularly at its centre. We are concerned that too many valuable plots of land are being redeveloped as housing projects, as opposed to what Chellaston really needs which is better community facilities – better shops, a better medical centre, and better leisure provision, particularly for our young people, whilst retaining and improving the open spaces that we have. The problem is that the planners can only do so much – they can only judge schemes which are put forward by developers on the basis of whether those schemes comply with the planning guidelines, but they are not able to influence what type of scheme is submitted or whether it is appropriate for the neighbourhood. In other words, if applications are made to demolish the centre of Chellaston entirely and to erect only houses and flats, the planners would be powerless to prevent it happening. Or, so we thought, until we discovered something that might help to put a brake on the unsympathetic developments. That something is a “Supplementary Planning Document” (SPD) which is something which is drawn up by a community and which the planning authorities must take in to account when considering any planning application. We have looked at SPDs which have been produced by other communities across the country and we think that such a document, as long as it is properly produced and accepted by the City Council, would be a powerful tool in our campaign to get a central area which is fit for our expanding population. It is going to be a big job to get to that point and I am pleased that we already have an enthusiastic group doing some of the preliminary work. However we will need lots of help if we are to produce the SPD within a reasonable timescale. We would like to hear from residents with professional skills in civil engineering, construction, planning and technical writing, to name but a few. We will need to consult with residents across Chellaston and we will need canvassers, leaflet distributors and people to analyse the data. If you feel, as we do, that the future of Chellaston lies in the hands of its residents, please do get in touch with us, even if you only have a small amount of spare time. The more people we have on this project, the sooner the Chellaston SPD will be a reality.</p>
<p>Another concern, particularly for the residents of West Chellaston, is the access road for the Business Park to be built on Sinfin Moor. This is planned to be Holmleigh Way, without any further modification. It is our view that this road will quickly become inadequate, as the Business Park is not only bigger than originally planned, but also a significant amount of its area will be given over to warehousing which will require servicing by HGVs. The single-carriageway section of the road is barely wide enough for this type of traffic and the houses have been allowed to be built right up to the road so that they are bound to suffer noise and vibration once the Business Park starts to be occupied. A children’s play area is also sited alongside this road. At peak times, traffic will back up from the Bonnie Prince roundabout and it is likely that other roads on the estate as well as Parkway will be affected by rat-running. We feel strongly that the road design needs to be re-thought in order to minimize its impact on the residents and we have already taken a number of actions. We have asked the City Council to comment on various questions that we asked at a recent full Council meeting; we have had a meeting with a number of City Council officers and Lucy Care, the Cabinet Member for Highways and Transportation; and we are meeting with the developers, Wilson Bowden to put forward some alternative proposals. We need more residents from West Chellaston to contact us to let us know how they think the Business Park will affect them and what they understood about the Business Park when they first bought their houses. Responses to the web-site, please.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I’m sure most residents have spotted the new youth shelter on the Recreation Field behind the Community Centre. This is the culmination of two years’ work by the CRAG sub-group and also results from generous donations from local businesses such as the Co-op. We are pleased to note that the younger residents started using it straight away and have already embarked on a re-decoration programme. We may have some money left over which we can hopefully use to complete the as yet unfinished ground works.</p>
<p>Finally, those who use the buses will have noticed that routes and timings have changed, although, unfortunately, at the time of writing, not according to the bus stop information on display. Arriva have published booklets and there is other information available, including that on our own web-site, so I hope that those who need to know have been able to find out times and which stops to use. Whilst it is to be regretted that the 68 service has been withdrawn, there are some improvements, such as the links to East and West Chellaston in the evening and Sundays, and more early Sunday and late night buses. We have occasional contact with Arriva so let us have any comments you may have and we will pass them on.</p>
