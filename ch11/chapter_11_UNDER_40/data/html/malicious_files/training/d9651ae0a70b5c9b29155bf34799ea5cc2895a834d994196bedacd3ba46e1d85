<p style="text-align: left;">
This year my mom decorated her house in Red and White for Christmas so I created a cake to cordinate with her decor.The bottom tier is an 8 inch egg nog flavored cake. I made a traditional <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/white-almond-sour-cream-wedding-cake-69630">White Almond Sour Cream Cake(WASC)  recipe</a> and substituted egg nog for the liquid and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  The buttercream used Parisian Almond Cream coffee creamer for the liquid. You can use the powdered creamer, just heat the water and add equal parts dry creamer to water. That&#8217;s a tip I learned from Sharon at her Sugar Shack blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The top tier is a 6 inch chocolate cake with a cherry cranberry filling and ganache coating under the fondant.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supplies:<br />
</span></strong>Buttercream to ice the bottom tier<br />
2 1/2  lbs Red Fondant<br />
1/2 lb White Fondant<br />
1/4 lb White Gumpaste (or fondant with gum-tex or tylose added)<br />
2 jars of sparkling sugar (I combined the fine sanding sugar and chunky sparkling sugar because it&#8217;s what I had on hand)<br />
1 jar small white pearls (Wilton)<br />
2 6 inch cake boards<br />
2 8 inch cake boards<br />
1 large plastic cake board( larger than your largest cake)<br />
1 cake drum (10 inches or larger)<br />
A 1/2 sheet cake pan to catch sugar sprinkles<br />
Texture mat or rolling pin (optional)<br />
Large and small snowflake cutters<br />
Diamond Cutters (Medium and tiny) Atteco Diamond Cutter has ALL sizes in one set<br />
Long Wooden Skewers<br />
Paint brushes for caking<br />
Piping Gel</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chocolate Ganache:<br />
</strong></span>3 cups Bakers Semisweet chocolate<br />
1 1/2 cups heavy cream</p>
<p>I made the chocolate ganache for the top tier the day before because it needs to set. Since I was using the ganache under fondant, you want the ganache to be setting consistency (not pouring consistency). To do this use 2 parts chocolate (I used Baker&#8217;s Semisweet Chocolate squares) to 1 part heavy whipping cream. Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place in a bowl. Heat the cream to just before boiling and pour over chocolate. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes and then stir to melt the chocolate and combine the cream until mixture is smooth.  Cover tightly and let sit on the counter for several hours or overnight to cool.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAKE CONSTRUCTION:</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/red-and-white-snowflakes.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-348" title="red and white snowflakes" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/red-and-white-snowflakes-300x213.jpg" alt="sugared snow flakes" width="237" height="176" /></a>In addition to making the chocolate ganache the day before, you should make the gumpaste snowflakes for the toppers in advance so they have time to dry. You can do straight gumpaste, 50/50 gumpaste and fondant or fondant mixed with gum-tex or tylose. I used straight gumpaste because I had it on hand. Roll the gumpaste thin but not too thin because they will need to be able to hold themselves up once they dry. I cut out 3 large snowflakes. 2 for the front and 1 for the back (I like the back of my cakes to look pretty too).  I then cut out 3 small snowflakes as well. I let them all dry overnight. You should make 1 or 2 extras in case of breakage.</p>
<p>After the cakes are baked and cooled. Tape the 2 6 inch cake boards together and tape the 2 8 inch cake boards together.  I cover my boards in press and seal. If you&#8217;re not going to cover the boards, only use tape between the boards. Fill and stack the cakes on each board as you normally would.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/tesnt.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-360" title="food tent" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/tesnt-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="255" height="157" /></a>Place the 6 inch cake on a larger plastic board (I buy mine at Hobby Lobby and they&#8217;re washable so you rarely have to replace them). The ganache should be peanut butter consistency. If it&#8217;s not, put a portion of it in a smaller bowl and microwave on medium power in 30 second increments until it&#8217;s just spreadable consistency. Ice the cake so that it&#8217;s smooth and set it aside so the chocolate can set up. I am always worried about dust getting on my cakes until I found these awesome food tents. They&#8217;re 14 inches and plenty tall. I use them to keep my cakes covered between steps.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/red-and-white-sugared-white-layer.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-349" title="red and white sugared white layer" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/red-and-white-sugared-white-layer-300x225.jpg" alt="sparkling sugar " width="243" height="186" /></a></p>
<p>Next, place the 8 inch cake on the larger plastic cake board. The larger board makes it much easier to handle the cakes. Frost the bottom tier in buttercream. Line the bottom of your sheet pan with wax paper. Place your cake in the pan. Grab a handful of sparkling sugar and place it directly on the cake, gently but firmly press it into the sides of the cake. Work your way all around the cake.  The extra sugar will fall into the pan. Be sure and reuse the sugar that is dropped. Don&#8217;t forget to sugar the top of your cake as well. The cake should be very sparkly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sm-snowflakes.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC02837.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-352" title="DSC02837" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC02837-300x243.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="152" /></a>With the left over sugar in the pan, take the small snowflakes from the day before and paint piping gel on the front side of the each snowflake. Cover in the sparkling sugar. With the larger snowflakes, paint piping gel just along the edge of the snowflake. Be careful not to break them. I laid them (one at a time) directly in the pan with the sugar and just shook the pan until the sugar coated the edges. Set all the snowflakes aside to dry. Keep the sugar and pan handy,you may need it later.</p>
<p>Next you will want to roll out a small portion of the red fondant for the diamonds that go around the base tier. I used the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OEBVRS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=keonca-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000OEBVRS">Ateco 8 Piece Stainless Steel Diamond Shaped Cutter Set</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=keonca-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000OEBVRS" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. I love this set, I may have to stock up on all the other shapes soon:) Roll the fondant about 1/8 inch thick. Too thin and they will be hard to place onto the cake, too thick and they look funny. Take an impression mat or a textured rolling pin and roll over the fondant with good pressure. I used an impression mat that had swirls on it. Cut out the diamonds and let them set up for a few minutes. To apply them to the cake, paint a thin layer of piping gel or frosting to the back of the diamonds. Be sure and get the tips or they will not stick to the sugar. Place the first diamond on the front of the cake. Place a few to the left and then go back to the front and place a few to the right. Continue this process until you get to the back. The diamonds rarely line up perfectly, that&#8217;s why they call it the back.<a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/red-and-white-diamon.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-353" title="red and white diamond" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/red-and-white-diamon-300x159.jpg" alt="red fondant, pearls" width="300" height="159" srcset="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/red-and-white-diamon-300x159.jpg 300w, http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/red-and-white-diamon.jpg 943w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Roll out a small portion of white fondant and cut out the tiny diamonds that will cover the intersections of the red diamonds. Paint one side of the small diamonds with water or piping gel and place them in the sugar pan, shake gently until well coated. Attach the small diamonds to the intersection of the larger red diamonds. Place a dot of piping gel in the middle of each white diamond and place a pearl in the middle. While you&#8217;re still waiting on the ganache to set up you can decorate your snowflakes. Attach each of the small sugared snowflakes to the middle of the larger snowflakes using piping gel. Attach pearls in different patterns to each snowflake. I used piping gel but it didn&#8217;t hold as well as I had hoped on the dry gumpaste. Next time I will use frosting.</p>
<p>By now the ganache should be reasonably set. You will need to roll out the red fondant. To cover a 6 inch cake, typically you roll out 2 lbs of fondant and that gives you plenty of overlap to work with. If you&#8217;re careful you can save the scraps and use them later. Once the fondant is rolled out, apply the impress mat to the fondant. Apply piping gel or simple syrup to the ganache so that the fondant has something to adhere to. I use a paint brush and just paint it on.</p>
<p>Gently roll the fondant onto your rolling pin (trying hard not to squish the impressions) and apply it to the cake. Gently smooth the fondant down around the cake and trim off the excess. Again trying not to squish the impression out of the fondant. <br />
<a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/snow-edge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-354" title="sugared edge" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/snow-edge-300x241.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="192" /></a>Then roll out a 1/2 lb of white fondant.Trim the edge to look like snow fall. Use the bottom of a 6 inch cake pan to determine the size and shape you want. Apply piping gel to the top of the red tier and place the white fondant on top of it. Use your ball tool to adjust the shape if necessary. Once the white layer of fondant is applied. Using a paint brush, paint piping gel just along the edge of the white layer.  Place the left over sparkling sugar in a zip lock bag or piping bag and snip the end off so that the sugar comes out easier but not crazy fast. Go around the edge of the cake with the sugar and it should stick to the piping gel but not the rest of the cake.  I cut out a few more small snowflakes and attached them to the top tier.</p>
<p>I use the SPS (single plate system) as my support so at this point, I put the 6inch plate and pillars into the 8 inch cake and then placed my 6 inch cake on top of it. Other people prefer using dowels but I find SPS to be very easy to use. I then took a piping bag with a large round tip and piped &#8220;snow&#8221; around the top tier and around the bottom tier and of course added more sparkling sugar to the borders.</p>
<p>The last thing I needed to do was to attach the skewers to the snowflake toppers. I measured the height of the top tier and added a couple of inches to attach to the snowflakes and cut the skewers to size. Next I gently laid the snowflakes face down and laid the skewer over the snowflake. Then I took some fresh white gumpaste and using piping gel applied it to the back to completely attach the skewer to the snowflake. I did this for 2 of the snowflakes. I left the last one without a skewer because I wanted to lean it against the other two in the back. I let them dry for several hours.</p>
<p>I applied the snowflake topper after I arrived on-site and added a little more frosting to the base of the topper to finish the cake.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/drumsticks4.jpg"></a>I had seen this cake done before by other cake decorators and I have been wanting to try it for a while. So this year I had enough time to make one for our Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/finishedturkey101.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-296" title="Turkey Cake" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/finishedturkey101-300x225.jpg" alt="Turkey and Dressing Cake" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/finishedturkey101-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/finishedturkey101.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Supplies:</strong><br />
13X9 Oval cake pan<br />
9 inch heart cake pan<br />
Double batch of cake mix &#8211; (I used the <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/white-almond-sour-cream-wedding-cake-69630">White Almond Sour Cream cake</a>. The recipe link is a double batch already)<br />
<span>Double batch of <span>buttercream</span>.   (tint 6 cups of the frosting  a medium brown). My favorite BC is </span><a href="http://cakecentral.com/recipes/5163/sugarshacks-icing-and-tips"><span>Sugar Shack&#8217;s <span>Buttercream</span></span></a>. <em>I do NOT recommend using store bought frosting for this cake. It is very difficult to get a smooth finish with store bought frosting.<br />
</em><span>10 store bought Rice <span>Krispy</span> Treats (for wings and drumsticks)</span><br />
Brown Food Coloring<br />
2 Tablespoons of corn syrup<br />
2 Tablespoons of vodka<br />
Large rectangular cake boards- doubled and covered in press in seal wrap<br />
Paper towels<br />
Roasting Pan &#8211; I used the largest size for this cake<br />
Romaine Lettuce<br />
Small travel hairspray bottle (new &#8211; only to be used for cakes)</p>
<p><strong>How to construct the cake:</strong><br />
Prep the pan, using Homemade Cake Release (recipe found at the end of my <a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/2010/09/my-go-to-chocolate-cake-recipe/">Go to Chocolate Cake </a>post) or grease and flour the pans. Fill the heart cake pan 2/3 full with batter. Place the rest of the batter in the oval cake pan. Bake the oval and heart cakes until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool completely. You can freeze the cakes before carving to reduce the crumbs. I did not have time to chill my cakes in advance. You can see in my <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-285" title="Before Carving" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cake1-225x300.jpg" alt="Turkey Cake before Carving" width="187" height="245" />pics that it still worked out OK.  Level the oval cake so that it has a flat top surface.  Do not level the heart cake. The hump on the top of the cake will add to the natural shape of the turkey.</p>
<p>Before constructing the cake, trim your cake board so that it fits into the your roasting ban. My roasting pan was quite deep so I taped several cake boards together and placed them in the base to lift the cake to the desired height. <br />
<span>Place a small amount of <span>buttercream</span> on the board and place the oval cake cut side down. Place a layer of <span>buttercream</span> on the top of the oval cake and place the heart cake in your desired location.  Carve the large piece of excess cake from the oval. Do this in large chunks and save the cake scraps. You will use them later for the stuffing.</span><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/carvedcake21.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-287 alignright" title="Trimmed Cake" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/carvedcake21-225x300.jpg" alt="Trimmed Turkey Cake" width="171" height="214" /></a></p>
<p><span>At the pointed end of the heart cake, cut out a small cavity to represent the turkey opening. Shape the cake to simulate the shape of the turkey. Be sure to carve along the sides so that the two layers don&#8217;t look like two distinct cakes.  It does not need to be perfect because you can adjust the shape using extra <span>buttercream</span>. </span></p>
<p>Crumb coat the cake and  leave it to set up. Crumb coating a cake is done by thinning down a portion of icing and rough icing the cake to seal in all of the crumbs. This makes icing the cake later much easier and gives you a crumb free final coat. While the crumb coat is setting up, make the drumsticks and the wings. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/drumsticks41.jpg"></a><br />
<span>Use 2 1/2 Rice <span>Kripsy</span> Treats (RKT) for each drum stick.  To shape the drumsticks, take 2 <span>RKTs</span> and smashed them together with your hands then roll them into the shape of a fat cone. Take 1/2 of another RKT and shaped it as a </span><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/drumsticks41.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-289" title="Drumsticks" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/drumsticks41-300x225.jpg" alt="Rice Krispy Treat Drumsticks" width="227" height="130" /></a><span>skinny log. Press your thumb into the bottom of the log to give it a stubby end. Then squish the log onto the cone, and using your fingers smooth the seam together so it makes a single drum stick.  For the wings, take 1 1/2 rice <span>krispy</span> treats and shape into a longer cone shape. Make the tail of the cone a bit longer and pointier than you would for the drumsticks. Because the wings have sharper angles, press the edges of the wings between your two palms to get a sharper edge.</span><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/crumbcoatwlegs5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-290 alignright" title="Completed Crumbcoated Turkey" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/crumbcoatwlegs5-300x242.jpg" alt="Crumbcoated Turkey Cake" width="246" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>Place the wings and drumsticks along the sides of your crumbcoated turkey cake. Crumb coat the wings and the drumsticks so that the lines between the legs and wings are smooth with the turkey. Do not use too  much frosting on the legs and wings or you will loose their definition.</p>
<p><span>Frost the turkey cake (including legs and wings) in the brown <span>frostings</span>. Notice I was not careful with getting perfectly smooth frosting on my cake. Since my heart cake had not risen as high as I had hoped, I built up the frosting to make the hump on the turkey&#8217;s back.</span><br />
Once the cake is frosted, let the buttercream crust. This means you let the frosting setup so that it is not sticky to the touch. While the cake is crusting, cut the cake scraps you saved from earlier into small square to resemble stuf<a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/frostedturkey6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-291 alignleft" title="Base Frosting" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/frostedturkey6-300x243.jpg" alt="Rough Frosted Turkey Cake" width="300" height="243" srcset="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/frostedturkey6-300x243.jpg 300w, http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/frostedturkey6.jpg 473w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>fing. Place them on a cookie sheet and bake them for 10 minutes at 325 degrees or until they have bit more color to them .</p>
<p>Now that the frosting has crusted, to smooth the icing you will need your paper towels. Place the paper towel on the cake, textured side to the cake. Rub your hand over the paper towel to smooth out the frosting. Rub the cake with a gentle pressure, enough to smooth out the creases but not to actually shift the icing. If you lift the paper towel and the frosting sticks then the frosting did not crust enough and you need to let it set longer. Crusting can take anywhere from 10 min to 30 min depending on your recipe, humidity etc. By placing the paper towel texture side down, it leaves an impression in the frosting that helps mimic the turkey skin.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bottle9.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-294" title="Spritze Bottle" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bottle9-166x300.jpg" alt="Bottle to color turkey cake" width="111" height="236" /></a></p>
<p>Next you will want to color the turkey so it looks more realistic. Most people use an airbrush, however I do not own one so I had to improvise. Take a new small travel hair spray bottle and fill it about 1/2 full with vodka. Then add a significant amount of brown food coloring. Add however much food coloring you think you need and then add more:) Add corn syrup to the bottle until the bottle is about 3/4 full. Place the cap on the bottle and shake well to mix the ingredients. Spritz the cake on all sides until you reach the desired color and look. It doesn&#8217;t take very much of the corn syrup mixture to get the desired effect.  When you spritz the cake it has a tendency to go everywhere so I placed a cake board behind the cake as I spritzed it. You can see in the picture there is also a faint hint of color on the cake board. The board will be covered but I did use a dry paper towel to wipe off as much excess as I could.  The corn syrup vodka mixture will add both sheen and color to your cake. The corn syrup will also be slightly sticky and needs to dry.<br />
<a href="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/turkeyspritzed8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-292" title="Spritzed Turkey Cake" src="http://www.keeponcaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/turkeyspritzed8-300x225.jpg" alt="Frosted Turkey Cake" width="257" height="174" /></a><span>I left my cake in a cake box with paper towels over the top (not touching the cake) until we needed to leave.  Next wash the romaine lettuce leaves and place them on a kitchen towel (or paper towel). Dry the leaves VERY well. Place the turkey cake in the roasting pan. Trim the lettuce and place it gently around the cake to cover the cake board. Take the toasted cake scraps and sprinkle them in the cavity opening and around the turkey cake to add to the effect.</span></p>
