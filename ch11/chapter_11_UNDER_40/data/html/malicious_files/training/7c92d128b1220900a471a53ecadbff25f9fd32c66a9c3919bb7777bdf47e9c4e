			<h1>Chairman’s Corner – Issue 19</h1>
<p>Chello Concerto</p>
<p>We held our AGM in March and once again, it proved to be an interesting evening for those residents who attended. We invited Margaret Beckett M.P. along to address the gathering as she now has Chellaston included in her constituency and we felt that residents might find it useful to be able to put questions directly to her. I should say straight away that our reasons for giving her the opportunity to address the meeting have nothing to do with political considerations – we are, always have been and, as long as our constitution remains the same, always will be a non‐political organisation. I know some people were unhappy about our choice of guest, but the fact remains that Mrs. Beckett is our M.P. and, until we change the voting system to P.R., the only one we have. The CRA thinks that it is better to work with MPs and councillors of whatever political persuasion to achieve results for Chellaston. The range of questions that Mrs Beckett was asked to answer ranged from the UK’s involvement in foreign countries to explaining what the alternative vote was all about. Somewhat surprisingly, very few questions actually related to what is happening in Chellaston but nevertheless Mrs. Beckett’s comments gave much food for thought and the CRA is appreciative of her contribution to the evening.</p>
<p>We would of course like to see more of our residents come along to these annual events and are going to consider possible alternative formats for next year. Perhaps a complete change of day and combining the AGM with something like a community fair would encourage more people to attend and take an interest in local matters. We would like to hear what you think about this – we can only represent you, the residents, properly if we are getting your views.</p>
<p>We have just had a local election and we have a new councillor, Phil Bailey, who we look forward to working with in his new capacity. Phil is, of course, no stranger to the CRA as he has been one of our members in recent years and in that time has worked tirelessly on various projects and problems in Chellaston – most notably the Supplementary Planning Document for the central area which is now nearing completion. We are sure that Phil will now be devoting his energies to his councillor duties and we would remind him, as we do all of our councillors, that they have been elected to represent Chellaston and Shelton Lock and not to use their position for political point‐scoring, which is actually a big turn‐off for the average resident and is probably one of the reasons for the low turn‐out in local elections.</p>
<p>Finally, a word about policing in Chellaston which, I think we would all agree has taken on a higher profile in recent times. The problem of young people grouping near to shopping areas seems to have moved from Tesco’s to the new shop area in west Chellaston. The police have become more active there over the last few weeks and are now proposing an exclusion order for that area. This will mean that people wishing to visit the shops will not be intimidated by the groups but we have to bear in mind that young people will congregate somewhere so where will they go next? We think that there have to be carrots as well as sticks and we wonder if there is enough being done to provide alternative facilities in the area. Much good work is already being done with the youth club and we know there are others who feel that this is a problem that needs to be addressed. What we need is to seriously look at what we, along with the Neighbourhood Board and the City Council could reasonably provide. I would like to open the debate now and welcome any contributions from residents on this subject.</p>
