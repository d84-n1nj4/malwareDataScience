Finally, the new stud configuration. On release, I was pleased to see Nike had taken a fresh approach with this release, and in-game it does have plenty of positives including a high level of quality traction. BUT, and there is an important but, Nike has failed to create a truly advanced configuration. In fact, they have placed a stud toward the front of the boot that cause some discomfort. It is the second stud front to back of the boot that sits on the instep. (as per the picture above). What is odd about this stud is that it sits higher than the front stud, and this causes pressure on firm surfaces. I actually don't understand the logic behind its dimensions and feel it is an area that Nike are going to have to address. Having also encountered sharp studs on the Vapor VIII, I'm starting to wonder what is going on in the stud configuration designer department!.

In similar fashion to a regular boot, these feature laces and that allows you to tighten them as needed. If you look at something that is somewhat comparable to the Magista like the Lotto Zhero Gravity (in terms of “no tongue”), the Magista has the distinct advantage of allowing you to zip the boot tight to your foot simply by applying the laces in your own personal fashion. And you don't need to worry about any unnecessary gaps provided by a standard synthetic considering how Flyknit curves the shape of your foot. <b>soccer cleats girls</b> ,<b>soccer cleats girls</b>,

Would I Buy?For me it's a massive yes. I'm glad I didn't stump out the $149.99 for them (got them as a Christmas gift), because it's a lot of money for a turf boot, when you aren't 100% sure. But having used them for the last month, I'd definitely have no qualms down the line spending that money. I'm actually eagerly awaiting my outdoor season so that I can run them out a few times in my 11 a side league which takes place on artificial grass. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/orangesuperfly/nike-mercurial-superfly-4-sports-direct/">Nike Mercurial Superfly 4 Sports Direct</a> <b>soccer cleats girls</b> 
In fine Nike fashion, there is now an Autumn colorway that would look extremely appropriate on any field as we move through the beginning of most seasons. It comes in the Nike CTR360 Maestri III range and is officially labelled as a White/Volt/Pine Green. We actually included some details about this boot in a post earlier this week that explained Nike's decision to move their entire range to ACC Technology. But this is the first up-close and personal look.
