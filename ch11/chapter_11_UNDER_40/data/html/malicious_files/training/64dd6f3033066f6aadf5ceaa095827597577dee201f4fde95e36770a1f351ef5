			<p>I&#8217;ve been away for far too long.  For that I apologize.  I understand that I will have to work hard to make it up to those readers who left comments in the past couple years.  Yes, I said &#8216;couple years.&#8217;</p>
<p>Tonight I&#8217;m wading through the over 46,000 comments that have accumulated in my absence.  A formidable task that is sure to take many of my evenings.   From what I&#8217;ve seen so far, I&#8217;d estimate that well over 75% are spam.  As the saying goes &#8220;there ought to be a law!&#8221;  Once I get through this step, I will be answering comments that warrant it &#8211; and I&#8217;ve seen many comments in the few hundred I&#8217;ve waded through already that are deserving.  As I work through this process, I will also start posting again.  I&#8217;ve already got a couple posts written &amp; waiting.  Over this broad span of time I&#8217;ve started but not finished working on many ideas.  The jobs that have been paying the bills can be so distracting.  For that reason, this re-start may be slow &#8211; but I&#8217;m determined to make it sure.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t thank you all enough for reading my posts and commenting.</p>
<p>Posting for you again soon &amp; looking forward to more of your comments!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A lemon tree may seem an odd choice for a baby gift, yet you have to admit, it is different and unique!  However, you may be wondering, ‘is a lemon tree appropriate?’  I think so.</p>
<p>Many people send plants, flowers or gift baskets to the hospital or home to commemorate a baby’s birth.  Trees are sometimes planted to mark the event.  It is so amazing to say to your child years later ‘we got that tree when you were born.  It was just a twig and look at it now!’  My lemon tree suggestion is just a variation on that tree theme.  The big difference is that the lemon tree should be producing fruit when you have that conversation with your child.</p>
<p><strong><em>4 Great Reasons to Give a Lemon Tree:</em></strong><br />
<strong>Education</strong><br />
A child’s lemon tree can provide almost unlimited teachable moments.  Here are some topics that quickly come to my mind: gardening, pruning, nature, energy (make a battery with lemon), butterfly life-cycle &amp; host plants, nutrition, cooking (lemonade, lemon meringue pie, lemon chicken, etc.), household economy, household cleaning, entrepreneurship, plant natural history, plant/flower/fruit anatomy, aromatherapy, natural remedies…  Did I say unlimited?</p>
<p><strong>Lemonade Day</strong><br />
Lemonade Day has a short but rich history of inspiring and empowering children to think creatively and giving them real life experience as an entrepreneur.  A child’s lemon tree gives both child and parent inspiration and good reason to follow this path.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition &amp; Health Benefits</strong><br />
Children don’t always like to eat the foods that promote good digestive function and thus constipation is a not an uncommon issue.  Lemon aids in digestion and helps the colon work better.  Thus, lemon and real lemon lemonade can help control or even prevent diarrhea and/or constipation.  Lemon also helps the body cleanse itself of toxins.  A parent need only to look at the ingredient labels on the foods their children like to find a host of things that they can’t even pronounce let alone believe are good for their children.  Of course, lemon is a rich source of vitamin C, an important and necessary nutrient for a healthy body &amp; proper immune function.</p>
<p><strong>Economically Smart Gift</strong><br />
For the money you would spend on a nice vase of flowers or gift basket from a florist you can typically buy a young lemon tree.  Unlike a vase of flowers that will die or the food in a gift basket that will be eaten up in days if not mere hours and toys that will soon be outgrown, a lemon tree will give its gift of fruit, grocery savings and produce for a lemonade stand for many, many years.  When a child’s tree reaches peak productivity, that level of productivity typically lasts 10-15 years.  Most lemon trees live for 40 or more years and continue to produce fruit throughout their life, just not as prolifically.</p>
<p>Lemon trees perform best in low or no freeze regions.  However, many varieties can be grown in ½ barrels and maintained in large shrub form with pruning.  Thus, in colder regions when the winter’s first freeze arrives your lemon tree can be moved to a protected location with strong natural or artificial light, such as an atrium, greenhouse or garage.  In the spring, your potted lemon tree can then be moved back outside again.</p>
<p>Some of us long to give meaningful, inspired and unique gifts.  The gift of a lemon tree to commemorate a birth is just such a gift.  It is a gift both parent and child can enjoy and benefit from for more than just a few days, but rather, a lifetime.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I follow a tweeter who in profile at first claims in to be a plant hoarder, then retracts.  This person is an enthusiast I am sure.  We are of a kindred spirit.  As I haven’t yet had the fortune to transition to owning property, I sincerely believe that the apartment managers where I live would label me a ‘plant hoarder.’</p>
<p>There is a difference between the professionals, enthusiasts and hoarders even though by all appearances the 3 may at first blush seem the same.  Or perhaps it is just a matter of perspective.  One of my mentors at University of Florida had one of the most extensive, diverse and amazing orchid collections I’ve ever seen.  His specialty was, not surprisingly, orchid taxonomy and evolution.  He published regularly on the topic.  His home greenhouses were stuffed to the rafters with orchids and the trees in his yard were hung with specimens.  Yet I would not call him a hoarder.  Orchids were his passion, his business in life.  His orchids were well cared for, well-loved, well documented and he gave specimens to interested students.</p>
<p>In my case, I not only love plants but have an extensive, long-term investment in a botanical career.  One business goal I have set is to sell plants and thus I propagate.  I grow certain plants specifically to sell their greenery to a flower shop.  My collection also reflects my interest in edibles, medicinal uses, aromatherapy and beauty.   What would even a small container garden be without some beautiful flowering plants?  In addition to providing manna for our psyches, flowers attract bees and other beneficial wildlife.   Finally, apartment living in a big city can be hazardous and my plants serve the purpose of deflecting both eyes and potential bad guys.  Let’s face it, where prey is abundant, if it takes too much effort most predators will move on to easier prey.</p>
<p>Regardless of a professional’s or an enthusiast’s specific interest in plants, these folks who keep large collections typically trade or sell plants.  They also tend to talk or write about plants.  They are often members of plant or gardening related groups.  The most valuable service provided by those who keep large living plant and seed collections is to save varieties from extinction.  Imagine if there were no heirloom tomato enthusiasts in the world.  We would have long since been stuck with the latest and supposedly greatest hybrid red or GMO tomato.  One could imagine a similar fate for antique roses.  The plant collections of professionals and enthusiasts are to horticultural varieties what wild spaces are to native species, repositories of genetic potential.  Both plant collectors and wild spaces are vital to maintaining diversity.</p>
<p>As for the hoarder, this is the collector who does so reclusively.  Unfortunately, when such a person is forced to clean-up or passes away leaving someone lacking plant wisdom to dispose of the collection, rare genetic treasures can be lost to a dump.  It is the act of sharing that changes a person from a hoarder to an enthusiast and the career direction that makes a professional.  Sharing information and perpetuating diversity are paramount to maintaining an abundant planet with both natural and hybrid genetic resources.  If you have an extensive or large plant collection and are not already socially involved, I urge you to get out there and participate.  Trust me, someone undoubtedly wants a start from a plant you’ve got!</p>

			<p>Welcome to <strong><em>worldinplants.com</em></strong>.</p>
<p>People, all people, are very dependent upon plants.  From food to bio-fuels and so, so much more; my goal for this blog is to shine a bright light on the many aspects of that dependence.  Further, I believe in living as eco-friendly as possible and that theme will surely appear in many future posts.  Beyond sharing my rather broad ranging interests and expertise in plants, fungi, science, veggie-medicine and home &amp; garden, I hope to delight you with photos, trail tales, recipes, creative activities and my off-beat sense of humor.</p>
<p>Plants affect our lives in so many ways it is beyond amazing to me.  Even if the closest you get to a plant is eating the veggies in your pasta primavera, plants (and fungi) have a far greater influence on you than just nutrition.  From the air we breathe and clothes on our backs to the stock market, plants are major players in our daily lives.  Even as an educated scientist I am excited about this blog because I have so much to learn this work will continually propel me along that path.   For future posts I’ve already been exploring topics I have up to now successfully avoided – like farm futures and the commodities market.</p>
<p>As for the business of blogging, I do hope to make some money with this blog.  That means I will include advertising.  On occasion I may even review products for profit and/or seek sponsorships.  However, I can promise you that I’m not the type of person that will positively review a product I don’t like just to turn a buck.  Honestly, I am rather repulsed by that type of dis-integrity.</p>
<p>As for your comments, please, let’s be respectful of each other, learn together, have fun and keep it productive and positive.   I will present more explicit expectations of your comments only as necessary.  Until the time comes that I can’t keep up with job, writing, research and comments, I will review all of your comments before they are posted on the site.  I apologize in advance for slowing the process down, but not for saving you from annoying spam and/or disrespectful prose.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you come along with me on this blogging journey.  I pray you will find my thoughts, knowledge and work worthy of your time and that we can together create an interesting, fun and successful blogosphere community.</p>
<p>Thanks for the read!<br />
Dee</p>
