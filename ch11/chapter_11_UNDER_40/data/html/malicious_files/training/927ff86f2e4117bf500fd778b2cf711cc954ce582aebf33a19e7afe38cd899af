<p>
	Gavin Waller had been found. The news reported that Adam Pierce had stashed him away in a motel room with a week&rsquo;s worth of food and drugs. Gavin spent the week terrified that he would be found by authorities and executed on the spot. Twenty-four hours after the events downtown, Mad Rogan had brought him to the police station. The leading detective on the arson had publicly speculated that the only reason Gavin had survived at all was that Adam had been busy with his end-of-the-world plans and had simply forgotten the boy.</p>
<p>
	I hadn&rsquo;t heard from Rogan. All in all, that was a really good thing.</p>
<p>
	It was Saturday, and I was helping Grandma Frida with her latest project. One of the Houses had commissioned a hover tank from one of the other armored car garages. The tank neither hovered nor tanked very well. They&rsquo;d sunk a lot of money into it and had finally ended up selling it for scrap. Grandma Frida had bought it, and we were pulling it apart for spare parts. She&rsquo;d gone into the house to get a sandwich, and she&rsquo;d been gone for ten minutes. I sipped my hard cider. She&rsquo;d probably gotten distracted.</p>
<p>
	Someone stepped through the garage doorway. I squinted against the light. Mad Rogan.</p>
<p>
	He wore a dark suit. It fit him like a glove, from the broad shoulders and powerful chest to the flat stomach and long legs. Well. A visit from the dragon. Never good.</p>
<p>
	He started toward me. The track vehicle on his left slid out of his way, as if pushed aside by an invisible hand. The Humvee on his right slid across the floor. I raised my eyebrows.</p>
<p>
	He kept coming, his blue eyes clear and fixed on me. I stepped back on pure instinct. My back bumped into the wall.</p>
<p>
	The multiton hover tank hovered off to the wall. So that was the secret to making it work. You just needed Mad Rogan to move it around.</p>
<p>
	Rogan closed in and stopped barely two inches from me. Anticipation squirmed through me, turning into a giddy excitement spiced with alarm.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Are you planning on putting all of this back together the way you found it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	His eyes were so blue. I could look into them forever. He offered me his hand. &ldquo;Time to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;To go where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Wherever we want. Pick a spot on the planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Wow. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He leaned forward slightly. We were almost touching. &ldquo;I gave you a week with your family. Now it&rsquo;s time to go with me. Don&rsquo;t be stubborn, Nevada. That kiss told me everything I needed to know. You and I both understand how this ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I shook my head. &ldquo;How did this encounter go in your head? Did you plan on walking in here, picking me up, and carrying me away like you&rsquo;re an officer and I&rsquo;m a factory worker in an old movie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He grinned. He was almost unbearably handsome now. &ldquo;Would you like to be carried away?&rdquo;  </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The answer is no, Rogan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He blinked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;This is a long explanation, and you won&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I took a deep breath.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You have no regard for human life,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You saved the city, but I don&rsquo;t think you did it because you genuinely cared about all those people. I think you did it because Adam Pierce got under your skin. You hire desperate soldiers, but you don&rsquo;t do it to save them either. You do it because they offer you unquestioning loyalty. You rescued your cousin, but you had been content to ignore the existence of that whole branch of your family. Had you stepped into Gavin&rsquo;s life earlier, perhaps he would&rsquo;ve never met Adam Pierce. You don&rsquo;t feel that rules apply to you. If you want it, you buy it. If you can&rsquo;t buy it, you take it. You don&rsquo;t seem to feel bad about things, and you offer gratitude only when you need to overcome some hurdle. I think you might be a psychopath.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be with you, no matter how crazy you make me, because you have no empathy, Rogan. I&rsquo;m not talking about magic. I&rsquo;m talking about the human ability to sympathize. I would matter to you only as long as I had some use, and even then, I would be more of an object than a lover or a partner. The gulf between us, both financially and socially, is too great. You would use me, and when you were done with me, you would dismiss me like a servant and I would have to go back to pick up the pieces of my life, and I&rsquo;m not sure there would be anything left of it or of me by that point. So no, I won&rsquo;t go away with you. I want to be with someone who would if not love, then genuinely care, for me. You are not that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Pretty speech,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only one I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s really going on here. You&rsquo;re scared to step into my world. Afraid you can&rsquo;t hack it. Much better to hide here and be a big fish in a very small pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way you see it, fine.&rdquo; I raised my chin. &ldquo;I have nothing to prove to you, Rogan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But now I have something to prove to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I promise you, I will win, and by the time I&rsquo;m done, you won&rsquo;t walk, you&rsquo;ll run to jump into my bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hold your breath,&rdquo; I told him.</p>
<p>
	All of his civilized veneer was gone now. The dragon faced me, teeth bared, claws out, breathing fire. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t just sleep with me. You&rsquo;ll be obsessed with me. You&rsquo;ll beg me to touch you, and when that moment comes, we will revisit what happened here today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Never in a million years.&rdquo; I pointed at the doorway. &ldquo;Exit is that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He grabbed me. His mouth closed on mine. His big body caged me in. His chest mashed my breasts. His arms pulled me to him, one across my back, the other cupping my butt. His magic washed over me in an exhilarating rush. My body surrendered. My muscles turned warm and pliant. My nipples tightened, my breasts ready to be squeezed, ready for his fingers and his mouth. An eager ache flared between my legs. My tongue licked his. God, I wanted him. I wanted him so badly.</p>
<p>
	He let me go, turned on his toes, and went out, laughing under his breath.</p>
<p>
	Aaargh! &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Keep . . . walking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I threw the wrench down.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now that was a kiss,&rdquo; Grandma Frida said from the doorway behind me.</p>
<p>
	I jumped. &ldquo;How long have you been there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Long enough. That man means business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	All my words tried to come out at once. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t . . . what . . . asshole! . . . screw himself for all I care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Aww, young love, so passionate,&rdquo; Grandma said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to buy you a subscription to Brides magazine. You should start shopping for dresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I waved my arms and walked away from her before I said something I would regret.</p>
<p>
	Epilogue</p>
<p>
	He parked the car, got out, and looked at the house. A typical suburban home, a cookie-cutter traditional on a square of mowed grass. A dime a dozen in any subdivision. He walked to the door and tried the handle. Unlocked. Tom had said it would be.</p>
<p>
	He had left Thomas Waller with Daniela. By now Thomas was likely sedated. His teenage son had been arrested and charged with murder. His wife had disappeared. Then he&rsquo;d gotten an email from her, and the contents of it had broken the last shreds of resolve Thomas had. His hands had been shaking when they&rsquo;d spoken.</p>
<p>
	He walked through the house to the kitchen. A brand new laptop waited for him on the kitchen island, its box still nearby. Tom had followed the instructions in his wife&rsquo;s email to the letter.
