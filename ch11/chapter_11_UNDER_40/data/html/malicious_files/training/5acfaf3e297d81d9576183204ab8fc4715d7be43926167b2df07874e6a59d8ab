<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://a51e0npdi8pg9odr-glgwbr3la.hop.clickbank.net/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-527" title="crai ballantyne and bally" src="http://woldfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/crai-ballantyne-and-bally.jpeg" alt="crai ballantyne and bally" width="250" height="291" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s workout should consist of leg raises, biceps curls with soup cans, and triceps kickbacks with water bottles.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you believe that silliness?</p>
<p>Neither can I, but that is what passes for &#8220;professional fitness<br />
advice for women&#8221; these days.</p>
<p>I could see this info being accepted in the 1930&#8217;s (maybe?), but in the year 2007? Please&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-530 aligncenter" title="1920sBasketballPicture" src="http://woldfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/1920sBasketballPicture.jpg" alt="1920sBasketballPicture" width="328" height="335" /></p>
<p>Does anyone really believe that biceps curls with water bottles is going to prepare women to carry their children to bed, a bag of heavy groceries in from the car, or swing a sledgehammer during home reno&#8217;s?</p>
<p>No way. You need real-world workouts and fat loss advice. Not fluff.</p>
<p>Am I the only one that finds those types of recommendations disrespectful to the physical capabilities of women? You&#8217;d think that Linda Hamilton&#8217;s chin-up scene in Terminator 2 would have turned the tide of female fitness, or perhaps Demi Moore&#8217;s GI Jane.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve watched women get fit fast at almost any age with Turbulence Training. In fact, we&#8217;ve had girls from 18 to 82 years young kickin&#8217; butt with Turbulence Training.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-531" title="emily_Jeans-back" src="http://woldfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/emily_Jeans-back.jpg" alt="emily_Jeans-back" width="200" height="234" /></p>
<p>Today, I want to share the story of a classic &#8220;supermom&#8221;, you know the mom with 3 active kids that has to drive them everywhere, eat on the run, and still find room for workouts. Her name is Brandy Kirton, and she&#8217;ll show you how real women train, eat, and find the time to do it all with proper planning.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Brandy, tell us about your past exercise and nutrition experiences. At what point did you find out about Turbulence Training and what persuaded you to start using it?</p>
<p><strong>BK</strong>: I started working out back on high school. I&#8217;m 32 now.</p>
<p>I became a personal trainer for a few years in my early 20&#8217;s. So I learned a lot about nutrition and weight training. I have been in great shape and not so great shape in the last 10 years. I think I found Turbulence Training just surfing the web and decided to give it a try. I was desperate to lose weight after my 3rd kid.</p>
<p><strong>CB</strong>: And how was this a change from what you had done in the past?</p>
<p><strong>BK</strong>: I was doing 30 minutes of cardio and then lifted for 30 mins 3 to 4 times a week. That was if I actually could make time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-532" title="woman-on-treadmill" src="http://woldfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/woman-on-treadmill.jpg" alt="woman-on-treadmill" width="468" height="305" /></p>
<p>I would not work out if I knew I couldn&#8217;t get it all in. I would think, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point of 20 mins?&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> What kind of results have you achieved with Turbulence Training? And is there anything else, besides the results, you love about the Turbulence Training programs?</p>
<p><strong>BK: </strong>I love how it changes every month so I never get bored. I also love that I have no excuse about not having time to fit it in.</p>
<p>My results have been great. I am getting toned up and consistently losing inches. I also have a lot more energy.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Do you workout at home or in a gym?</p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> I have to work out at home. No time to get to a gym.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-538" src="http://woldfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Woman_exercise_ball_pushups-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Has Turbulence Training had a positive impact on your lifestyle?</p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> Turbulence Training has made a huge impact on me. I don&#8217;t feel like it takes up my whole day or get bored of the same thing day in and day out.</p>
<p>I feel strong and love the daily emails. It helps me stay motivated.</p>
<p>I work full time, have three kids 9, 5, and 11 months, and a husband. My older two kids play every sports so there really is no extra time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-537" title="soccer_mom_2008" src="http://woldfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/soccer_mom_2008.jpg" alt="soccer_mom_2008" width="284" height="400" /></p>
<p>I have to get up at 5:30 to work out before they wake up but its worth it. I feel great after I am done and no matter what happens that day I have already got my work out in which feels great.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> Do you have any social support? If so, how has this helped you?</p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> My mom comes over in the mornings to work out with me. I need that accountability so that I don&#8217;t sleep instead. Its hard to get up but I always feel so much better when I do.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> What are your daily obstacles and temptations that you have to avoid with respect to nutrition and training? And what strategies do you use?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-536 aligncenter" title="Girls can do anything!" src="http://woldfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/obstacle-rock.jpg" alt="Girls can do anything!" width="430" height="284" /></p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> With all the practices, games and running around I have to do its hard not to grab McDonald&#8217;s with the kids.</p>
<p>I try to either bring food with me or wait until I get home. If I have to eat out I do try and find grilled chicken or subway.</p>
<p><strong>CB:</strong> How do you plan your nutrition?</p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> I have to go shopping on Sunday to stock up on all my healthy food. Otherwise I will eat whatever I can find which usually is not good for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-535" title="woman-with-shopping-cart" src="http://woldfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/woman-with-shopping-cart.jpg" alt="woman-with-shopping-cart" width="253" height="361" /></p>
<p><strong>CB: </strong>Thanks Brandy, keep up the great work.</p>
<p>****<br />
The message is clear. Plan, prepare, commit, and be consistent.<br />
Brandy didn&#8217;t use any magic pills or potions to succeed, she simply found a great workout plan, and did what she had to do.</p>
<p>As a supermom, Brandy practically has to create time out of thin air in order to do her workout, but again, she knows what she has to do and she does it. She&#8217;s committed. She has social support. She knows the correct options for eating on the run.</p>
<p>She has made the effort to plan for the obstacles (lack of time,<br />
workout motivation) that we all come across. And by doing that,<br />
she&#8217;s cleared a simple path to success.</p>
<p>And she doesn&#8217;t waste time in the gym with slow, boring cardio<br />
workouts. Instead, she sculpts her body in half the time with the<br />
Turbulence Training workouts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve learned quite a few things about losing weight.  My meat portion is no bigger than the palm of my hand.  My veggies account for 2/3 of my plate.  And I try to stay away from the white carbs or else I retain water and my appetite shoots out of control.  Keep a few good rules you can live with and you can meet your goals.</p>
