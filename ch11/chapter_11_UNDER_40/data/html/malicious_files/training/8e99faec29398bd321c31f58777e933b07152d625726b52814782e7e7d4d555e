			<p>The core purpose of panel systems is to deliver long term value &#8211; environmental, functional, and economic &#8211; to both the end user and investor. Austral Australia embraces a holistic and practical approach in providing a total solution. This is encompassed in working with all parties to understand and develop the best practical solution. The Austral partnership ethos embraces the key principles of the Right Advice, the Right Panel, the Right Application,the Right Installation.</p>
<p>We recognise that every client is unique and as such will have different needs, will have varying understanding of panel systems and their features, will have a requirement for a range of applications, will have environmental and work conditions they need to adhere to, and that all will have budget constraints for capital expenditure and on-going operational &amp; service costs. In order to assist our clients in achieving best value, we define the following engineering equation:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>  VALUE=</td>
<td>  FUNCTION<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
COST</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>By improving functions and outcomes you improve value.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>By reducing cost of capital expenditure and operating cost, you improve value.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Greatest VALUE is achieved when you optimise both function enhancement with reduced investment and operating cost.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Austral&#8217;s approach is to offer the customer choices that create VALUE and this is achieved through discussions to consider how to best achieve this value. Our advice is formed around the 5 principles:</h1>
<h1></h1>
<ul>
<li>    What do you need</li>
<li>    What function is required</li>
<li>    What are the activities</li>
<li>    What are the inherent risks</li>
<li>    What is the best solution for VALUE</li>
</ul>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <strong>RIGHT ADVICE </strong></td>
<td><strong><span class="Apple-tab-span">RIGHT PANEL</span></strong></td>
<td><strong>RIGHT APPLICATION </strong></td>
<td><strong>RIGHT INSTALLATION</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All projects must consider the many factors impacting on the selection of the right solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt intelligent compartmental design and layout, and identify high risk activities.</li>
<li>Include active fire protection systems to reduce risk.</li>
<li>Mandate good house keeping practices such as waste management, site security etc.</li>
<li>Consider location of neighbour&#8217;s activities and the risk imposed by their operations.</li>
<li>Deliberate storage of waste, dangerous and flammable materials.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>There are a range of panel systems, each with different configurations thus delivering a range of varying benefits. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colours: for heat absorption &amp; deflection, and aesthetic purposes.</li>
<li>Core: EPS, Mineral Wool, Xflam, PIR.</li>
<li>Steel thickness &#8211; for strength and protection.</li>
<li>Steel type: to suit environment challenges.</li>
<li>Profiles: to suit application and enhance aesthetics.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>The use of the panel system is defined by the initial requirements incorporated into the design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal performance</li>
<li>Workability and Adaptability</li>
<li>Load &amp; Strength</li>
<li>Fire risk &amp; Protection</li>
<li>Structural Character</li>
<li>Hygiene</li>
<li>Aesthetics / Architectural</li>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Combustible/ Inflammable  materials</li>
<li>People protection</li>
<li>Environmental conditions / benefits</li>
<li>Energy efficiency</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>The installation of panel systems is most important.</p>
<p>We fully support a range of installation methods that encompass :</p>
<ul>
<li>BCA Part J Compliant</li>
<li>BCA requirements &#8211; Group 1 &amp; 2</li>
<li>EPS Code of Practice &#8211; an advanced methodology approved by Fire Agencies.</li>
<li>FM Global &#8211; FM 4880, Class 1, methodology approved by global insurer &#8211; FM Global</li>
<li>EPS used to AS 1366.3.</li>
<li>Bluescope steel complies with Substrate &#8211; AS 1397 Paint Coating &#8211; AS/NZS 2728:1997 Type 3.</li>

			<h1>Knock Down Rebuild Designers</h1>
<div class="text-content">There are tons of homes out there that are falling apart and have been left and neglected for so long that they flat out are not worth repairing. Knock down rebuild designers can come in and fix these properties and make them presentable to the public again. Knock down rebuild designers essentially come in and take a property and completely reconstruct it. This means that the knock down rebuild designers will disassemble a home, as well as any other types of buildings and structures that are on the property, with the intention on fully clearing out the property, based on the way the owner of the property wants it.</div>
<div class="text-content"></div>
<div class="text-content">Once the knock down rebuild designers have fully cleared off the land and the excess materials, a new structure can be built.</div>
<div class="text-content"></div>
<div class="text-content">Most of the time the owner of the land will have a home, or a variety of buildings that they want the knock down rebuild designers to take care of, and then they will move on to this aspect of the project. One of the best things about working with <strong>knock down rebuild designers</strong> from <a href="http://www.luxurylivinghomes.com.au/knock-down-rebuild-melbourne/">http://www.luxurylivinghomes.com.au/knock-down-rebuild-melbourne/</a> is the fact that you can take a dilapidated property that likely has no value and is an eye sore, and can transform it into a nice property, with a new house or any type of new building. Knock down building designers are a crucial part of replenishing all sorts of properties and homes that have simply become too old and need to be removed.</div>

			<h1>Mannequins</h1>
<div class="text-content">
<p>Can you imagine what would happen if clothing stores didn’t use mannequins of any kind but only used humans to model their clothing? Not only would the store’s costs go up substantially for employees, but they’d also have to adhere to labor laws, they’d have to give more breaks to the models, it’s likely the models would get tired very quickly, and no model would want to stand up for the whole day on display. Also, many people would be creeped out to see a person standing up in place of mannequins, just so they can display new clothing.</p>
<p>The only time people really model clothing is when it’s for a runway or when they are walking around with the clothing on, not simply standing in one place for many hours to show off the clothes. Since it’s not ideal to allow a person to model clothing the way mannequins do, many businesses that sell clothes will stick with mannequins because they know that they can use them as often as necessary. There are no labor laws, no break schedule, no payment schedule, and no requirements for using mannequins other than to dress them in the clothing that is supposed to sell in the store.</p>
<p>Since a <a href="http://metrodisplay.com.au/product-category/mannequins/">mannequins from Metro Display</a> is easy to dress and use in the store, many have been purchased by clothing stores for years to help them sell clothing. Those who have yet to jump on the bandwagon and get a mannequin or several of them, need to hurry up and do so because they are losing out on a lot of potential customers that may not see the clothing unless they go in the store. Having a mannequin as a plastic model for your store is not only a great choice but a wise decision that will end up bringing you in additional funds as well as customers. A mannequin is low in cost and can easily bring in higher profits for your store if you choose to implement these models within your business.</p>
