<h2>See the great things people have to say about Naturally 4 U&#8217;s Colloidal Silver</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fell backwards into a window and ended up with a large piece of glass in the side of my gluteus for approximately two months, it had to be removed under a general anaesthetic The Surgeon was amazed how there was no infection internally – I told him and a nurse it was because I took Colloidal Silver internally. The Nurse wanted to know more. Her testimonial follows mine. <i>Brian Ph 0274833396</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have suffered with reoccurring Urinary tract infections everytime I got to the end of my prescription drugs the infection occurred again. Upon meeting Brian I purchased some of theNaturally 4 U Colloidal Silver and take it daily it has kept me infection free for 2 years and I notice my health is generally better overall. I find night shift more easier. I have even got my partner taking it. <i>Sandra (Nurse at North Shore Hospital)</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used Colloidal Silver for many years, it is marvellous for everything, we use it for sore throats, mouth ulcers, upset stomachs, scrapes and bruises. I use it in my eyes when they feel tired. I have also used it on my cat who has had all sorts of problems and hasn’t had to go to vet in years. My son has used the nasal spray and found it very beneficial . it is an ancient remedy and best is that it is natural. Try it you’ll love it and never be without it <i>Jill Potter Ph 445 3846</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My granddaughter, who is two years old, had a nasty wet inflamed area under her nostril which was grazed after falling over. The area was really moist due to her having a runny nose. We wiped her nose with a tissue, trying not to further inflame her sore nose area but it got quite red and a bit scabby. I tried the colloidal silver on a tissue and dabbed it on as often as I could. I couldn’t believe the next day when all the redness had disappeared, and the scab had further healed overnight. I would certainly recommend using this on young children it did the trick for me. <i>Janet Souness – <a href="mailto:jsouness@adhb.govt.nz">jsouness@adhb.govt.nz</a></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed a change in my elbows, one totally cleared up (psoriasis) after taking the Colloidal Silver it is pretty powerfull stuff. <i>Davina – 0800 4 refunds</i> Mother and Daughter</p>

<p>I have given the Colliodal Siver to my Cat, she was better within a couple of days. Also I woke up with a very sore throat and fly symptoms, after 1 teaspoon I noticed a difference. I gave some to my daughter who had been coughing.

<p>Jo, I am impressed so far with the Colloidal Silver. I first dosed my wee son Owen Saturday morning when his face was red and sore with eczema. After his nap the redness had completely disappeared. But more amazingly or just coincidence; he has slept through the past few nights and without nightmares since he was released from hospital just over a month ago Thanks so much, I plan to bring my friend in with her eczema&#8217;d boy during the week. A very happy and finally rested mother. <i>Julie. <a href="mailto:jm_gilchrist@hotmail.com">jm_gilchrist@hotmail.com</a></i></p>

<p>Hi Jo, It&#8217;s Chrissy here I saw you at your home just over a week ago about my ezema. I must say it is &#8220;heaps&#8221; better! thank you so much the Collidal Silver has helped my skin alot. I havn&#8217;t been ableto get a hold of my doctor regarding what blood type I am, but I am still very keen to find out what it is so I could perhaps eat better for my skin and my health. I will be needing a refill of Collidal Silver very soon but I will ring you. Also like to maybe get some advice or even a cream for the scarring. Thank you so much, &amp; I will be in contact. <i>Chrissy <a href="mailto:mul-lee267@hotmail.com">mul-lee267@hotmail.com</a></i></p>

<p>Hi Joanne, Yes it is wonderful stuff the Colloidal Silver. Marc seems to have alot my energy lately and our daughter&#8217;s eye is clearing up nicely. We put into your bank account the money that we owed you and wanted to say thank you again for giving two complete strangers credit. This was very much appreciated.

<p>To whom it may concern, -I have been using Naturally 4U &#8216;s Cellulitis Cream and Colloidal Silver for several months now and think it is absolutely amazing. I have had re-occurring cellulitis on both legs for the last few years now and have been in and out of hospital on IV antibiotic drips which is time consuming and inconvenient as I own my own business and employee 5 staff. I have now been out of hospital and kept out for over 6 months since using this cream daily. I would not hesitate to recommend either of these products to anyone as even my doctor commented that she has never seen my legs look so good. <i>Lorraine Pateman Mt Albert.</i></p>

<p>I meant to tell you – after my accident (dog bite Dec 09) huge problem was the itching. This would start up many times a day,was extreme. My eye wasnt draining, my cheek was always wet. I mentioned the horrible itching to the specialist at the last superclinic appt and said this was hindering healing, there was no interest and no suggestions from him. The last thing I wanted was a heavy greasy product to use in the heat of summer, and I didn’t want further eye irritation.Straight after the appointment I was driving past the “Chooky Farm” in Takanini and knew your product was in there. I chose the colloidal silver gel. I got into the car, ripped my glasses off and smeared the gel all over the left side of my face. Over the next hour small areas would break out ie nose tip, eye lid etc and then it was all gone. no more itching. That afternoon and night I kept smearing it about every half hour. The itching had completely stopped late that night. For several weeks after I used it many times a day in case it started up again. The good thing about the product is the “lightness” of it plus I could use it in my eye. Of course the eye draining was rectified too on the first day of using it. The pot lives in my handbag as I still need it occasionally ie wind or dust irrititation. For me it was a miracle product, as life was unbearable with the constant red angry skin around the scar lines.Thank you sooo much .(Am sure other facial dog bites too would experience this incredible itching – and it would help them immensely also) Thanks <i>Christine Breen</i></p>
