			<h2>We Need Prayer</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p><strong><em>Well today was a hard day Alyah started of OK, but as the day went on she started to have pains in her stomach. She sat up for school for the entire hour and then back to bed. She then had to have and X ray and a CT scan. Then she sat on my lap for an hour and she began to cry &#8220;mommy I just want to go home&#8221;. It breaks my heart that I cantÂ  get her home yet. I knew I had to do something so I called grandma and asked her to go to the store and get some marshmallows. When she got here I toOK Alyah and Alura for a walk on the unit and just let them through the marshmallows at the nurses. That put a big smile on her face. When we got back to the room she was wiped out. That was fun and I have to say we have some wonderful nurses here at the Amplatz Children&#8217;s Hospital. Thanks to all of you for putting a smile back on my babies face. It lifted up my heart even if it only last a few minutes. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>On a more serious note we got some of the results back from the biopsy and they said that Alyah didn&#8217;t have many cells in the marrow. So we have to start to think really hard about another transplant. They want to wait a week because to see if maybe just maybe some cells will grow. She also has an infection in her right lung. So they are still treating that. WE NEED PRAYER! I broOK down today right in front of the doctors, but when I returned to the room I made sure that my baby didn&#8217;t see that there was anything wrong with me. All I can say is please pray for all of us we need it badly. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. God bless you all</em></strong></p>
