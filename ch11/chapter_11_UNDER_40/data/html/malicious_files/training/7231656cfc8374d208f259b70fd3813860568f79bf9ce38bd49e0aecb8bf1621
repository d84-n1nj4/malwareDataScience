	&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve been working for him. And that&rsquo;s nearly seven years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A creature of habit. I get that.&rdquo; There wasn&rsquo;t much spontaneous about Max from what I&rsquo;d seen.</p>
<p>
	Donna cocked her head. &ldquo;More a huge sense of loyalty. As this area built up and lunch places opened up on every corner, Joey&rsquo;s business took a bit of a hit. Max has never gone anywhere else. He&rsquo;s even brought clients here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Donna&rsquo;s description jarred with the cold egomaniac I encountered in the office. I bit into my sandwich.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He can be challenging and demanding and a pain in the ass, but that&rsquo;s a big part of what&rsquo;s made him successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I wanted to be successful but still a decent human being. Was I na&iuml;ve to think that was possible on Wall Street?</p>
<p>
	Donna pressed the top layer of bread down onto the turkey with her fingertips, pushing the layers together. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not as bad as you think he is. I mean, if he&rsquo;d said your report was good to go, what would you have learned?&rdquo; She picked up her sandwich. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to get it all right your first time. And the stuff about the typos&mdash;was he wrong?&rdquo; She took a bite, and waited for me to answer.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No.&rdquo; I bit the inside of my lip. &ldquo;But you have to admit, his delivery sucks.&rdquo; I pulled out a piece of my turkey from under the sourdough and put it in my mouth. I&rsquo;d worked so hard; I&rsquo;d expected some kind of recognition for that.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Sometimes. Until you&rsquo;ve proved yourself. But once you have, he&rsquo;ll back you completely. He gave me this job knowing I was a single mother, and he&rsquo;s made sure I&rsquo;ve never missed a game, event, or PTA meeting.&rdquo; She cracked open a can of soda. &ldquo;When my daughter got chicken pox just after I started working here, I came into the office anyway. I&rsquo;ve never seen him so mad. When he spotted me, he marched me out of the building and sent me home. I mean, my mom was looking after her, she was fine, but he insisted I stay home until she was back in school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I swallowed. That didn&rsquo;t sound like the Max I knew.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a really good guy. He&rsquo;s just focused and driven. And he takes his responsibility to his employees seriously&mdash;especially if they have potential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see him taking his responsibility to not be a condescending asshole very seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Donna chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re there to learn, to get better. And he&rsquo;s going to teach you, but just saying you did a good job isn&rsquo;t going to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I grabbed a napkin from the old-fashioned dispenser at the edge of the table and wiped the corner of my mouth. How had today helped me other than wrecking my confidence completely?</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If you had known how today&rsquo;s meeting would play out, what would you have done differently?&rdquo; Donna asked.  </p>
<p>
	I shrugged. I&rsquo;d done good work, but he&rsquo;d refused to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Come on. You can&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;d do things exactly the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Okay, no. I would have printed out the sources and brought them into the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Donna nodded. &ldquo;Good. What else?&rdquo; She took another bite of her sandwich.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I would have probably tried Max&rsquo;s contact at the WTO a few more times&mdash;maybe emailed him. I could have tried harder to pin him down. And I could have sent the whole thing to proofreading.&rdquo; We had an overnight service, but because I&rsquo;d worked late on it, I&rsquo;d missed the deadline to send it. I should have made sure it was ready in time.</p>
<p>
	I glanced up from picking apart my sandwich. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying I didn&rsquo;t learn anything. I just thought he&rsquo;d be nicer. I&rsquo;ve wanted to work with him a long time. I just didn&rsquo;t imagine I&rsquo;d fantasize about punching him in the face quite so often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Donna laughed. &ldquo;That, Harper, is what having a boss means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Okay, I could accept that Max was nice to Donna, and Joey, by the looks of things. But he wasn&rsquo;t nice to me. Which only made everything worse. What had I ever done to him? Was I being singled out for special treatment? Yes, my report could be improved, but despite what Donna said, I hadn&rsquo;t deserved the reaction I got. He could have thrown me a bone.</p>
<p>
	Now that my expectations of working with Max were well and truly shattered, I had to concentrate on getting what I could from the experience and moving on. I&rsquo;d go through my report and make it perfect. I&rsquo;d take everything I could from working for King &amp; Associates, make a ton of contacts, and then after two years I&rsquo;d be well placed to set up on my own, or go and work directly for a bank.</p>
<p>
	* * * * *</p>
<p>
	How I&rsquo;d talked my best friend, Grace, into moving me into my new apartment, I had no idea. Growing up on Park Avenue, she wasn&rsquo;t raised for manual labor.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in here, a dead body?&rdquo; she asked, a sheen of sweat on her forehead catching the light in the elevator.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yeah, my last best friend.&rdquo; I tipped my head toward the old pine blanket box at our feet and the last thing in the truck. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s room for another.&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There&rsquo;d better be wine in the refrigerator.&rdquo; Grace fanned her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not used to being this physical with my clothes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You see, then you should be grateful. I&rsquo;m expanding your horizons,&rdquo; I replied with a grin. &ldquo;Showing you how us ordinary gals live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I&rsquo;d been staying with Grace since I got to New York from Berkeley almost three months ago. She&rsquo;d been fantastically understanding when my mother shipped all my things to her apartment in Brooklyn, but now that I was making her help me move everything into my new place, her patience was running out. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m too poor for a refrigerator. And wine.&rdquo; The rent on my studio was horrific. But it was in Manhattan and that was all I cared about. I wasn&rsquo;t about to be a New Yorker who lived in Brooklyn. I wanted to milk this experience for everything it was worth, so I&rsquo;d sacrificed space for location&mdash;a small Victorian building on the corner of Rivington and Clinton in Lower Manhattan. The buildings on either side were covered with graffiti, but this place had been recently refurbished and I&rsquo;d been assured it was full of young professionals, being so close to Wall Street. Professional what? Hitmen?</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be . . . cozy,&rdquo; Grace said. &ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to ask about the one bedroom across the hall from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	My apartment at Berkeley had been at least twice the size of my new place. Grace&rsquo;s place in Brooklyn was a palace in comparison, but I was okay with small. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. It&rsquo;s all part of the New York experience, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
