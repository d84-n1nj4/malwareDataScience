    <td width="698">The Bomba Finale on the other hand is a very solid and high performing boot that left very little to be desired, it performed better than quite a few pro level FG boots. Unfortunately the Finale is selling out pretty quick as it was replaced by the Finale II a few months ago so you better snatch up the remaining pairs quick if you are interested. Its a shame that Nike didn&#8217;t make a boot of equal quality to the predecessor but I&#8217;m sure some will prefer the Finale II to the first.Critics Notes...</td>

  <p>Calum Chambers (Arsenal) Nike Magista Obra Calum Chambers (Arsenal) Nike Magista ObraThe mid-cut collar creates a secure fit in play and I can see the benefits of its implementation on an indoor or turf specific shoe. It doesn&#8217;t provide real life support, but it does add a feeling of security as you chop and turn sharply. In similar fashion to other similar boots we have tested (like the Superfly) it doesn&#8217;t overstretch through play ¨C a common concern for players. But it does start to smell if you don¡¯t keep it dry (Flyknit material!)...</p>
  <p>Each design was unique and was a truly custom boot as the designs were for the player alone and were not released to the public for purchase! Xavi, Steven Gerrard, and Andrey Ayew all received boots to celebrate their last home games for Liverpool, Barcelona, and Marseilles, with all three leaving the club at the conclusion of their respective seasons. Eden Hazard&#8217;s custom boots were designed to commemorate his awards collected during the season, such as the Professional Footballer&#8217;s Association Player of the Year Award.Toni Duggan (Manchester City) Umbro Geo Flare Toni Duggan (Manchester City) Umbro Geo Flare...</p>
  <p>?2. Pitch CoverageFootball, particularly in the rarified air of the World Cup, can come down to a matter of inches. From Geoff Hurst&#8217;s disputed goal in 1966 &#8211; no goal-line technology then &#8211; to Luis Suarez&#8217;s handball versus Ghana in 2010, fine margins and foul play have played a huge role in the history of the tournament. No moment combines the two like Toni Schumacher&#8217;s foul in 1982. With the scores tied at 1¡ª1 in the second half, Michel Platini lofts the ball in behind the German defence, releasing Patrick Battiston. The Frenchman clips the ball past the onrushing Schumacher. The ball rolls agonizingly wide, and the goalkeeper &#8211; who had ample time to divert his course &#8211; clatters the attacker. The unconscious Battiston is stretchered off, his jaw broken and missing three teeth. The referee awards no more than a goal kick and the Germans go on to win, sparking outrage worldwide....</p>
   <p>My 2012 Euro Best XI All Star Team &#8211; Ministry of SoccerNike have?borrowed heavily from their showpiece boot the Mercurial Superfly. The top end Elastico?features the same flyknit upper with flywire cable supports and the same dynamic fit collar as the Mercurial Superfly. Also the medial side of the boot receives and additional coating of the Nikeskin to aid the touch where a player contacts the ball most often. Nike also state the boot has been lowered to bring a players foot closer to the ground. This innovation is designed to aid manipulation of the ball on the pitch....</p>
