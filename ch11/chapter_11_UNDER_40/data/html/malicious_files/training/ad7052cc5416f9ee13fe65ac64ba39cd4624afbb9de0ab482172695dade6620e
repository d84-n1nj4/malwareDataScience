<p>I 1st found out about the<a title="http://www.thekolstrandbuilding.com/" href="http://www.thekolstrandbuilding.com/" target="_blank"> Kolstrand building</a> because of the two great restaurants that were located there:   (1) <a title="http://ethanstowellrestaurants.com/stapleandfancy/" href="http://ethanstowellrestaurants.com/stapleandfancy/" target="_blank">Staple &amp; Fancy Mercantile</a> which is an Ethan Stowell restaurant and (2) <a title="http://thewalrusbar.com/" href="http://thewalrusbar.com/" target="_blank">The Walrus and the Carpenter</a> which is a wonderful oyster / seafood restaurant hidden in the back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried both of them and definitely enjoy the vibe and food better at The Walrus and the Carpenter.  The other time I ran into the building was because of the <a title="http://www.dutchbikeseattle.com/" href="http://www.dutchbikeseattle.com/" target="_blank">Dutch Bike Company</a> located in the front.  I bought a Living Social or Groupon deal and took my bike in for a tune-up.  They were very friendly and professional.</p>
<p>But then I realized that I knew Bryce, who worked on putting the Kolstrand deal together. He biked passed the building and discovered it was for sale.  After a lot of TLC, he really brought it to live.  But what most people <em>don&#8217;t see </em>is that they also have an underground wine storage and tasting room (members only and private dining events catered from the restaurants above).  Plus they have a bunch of design and agency businesses upstairs.  And this is where they really shine.  It was done so nicely and feels like Manhattan meets Tokyo up there.  I felt like being a hipster and brainstorming on my Mac Book Pro when I walked in!</p>
<p>And I also saw the old brick work and lo and behold!  There&#8217;s an old logo for a Staple &amp; Fancy general store&#8230;now you know where the name comes from.  Thanks for the tour Bryce and congrats on your success!</p>

<p>Mike Davidson is my hero!  Not only is he a successful entrepreneur having started and sold <a title="Newsvine" href="http://newsvine.com" target="_blank">Newsvine </a>to Microsoft, but he also took his hard earned money to buy, demo, and build his <a title="A House By the Park" href="http://ahousebythepark.com" target="_blank">dream home in Magnolia</a>.  In addition, he details all the steps and costs in the process.  His attention to detail and transparency is so refreshing, candid, and informative to anyone who is tempted to do their own project.</p>
<p>Kudos to Mike!  I knew he ran a news startup, but I didn&#8217;t know he could write like a Pulitzer winning reporter too <img src='http://northwestlivingdesign.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>At <a href="http://www.stagingetc.com">Staging Etc</a>, my former business partner at I were never completely happy with any of our home designs. We would design a home with a perfectly beautiful red and black color theme. Then the next week would get warm as the season suddenly turned to spring and we would decide to redesign the home with greens and yellows. And then, golds starting to become popular again while chrome and silver were becoming passé. Does it ever end?! And where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that it doesn&#8217;t end and a design left to sit for too long simply becomes stale. Design is a living thing that changes constantly and the challenge for a designer is to keep up with the latest and greatest trends (almost as hard as keeping up with the Kardashians!)</p>
<p>Northwest Living Design will give you home design tips to easily keep your look current, provide news and resources of things we simply <em>love!</em>, and keep you updated on our personal home project in the making.</p>
<p>Speaking of things I <em>love!</em>, my former business partner Lindsay did the staging for this home. I will definitely borrow some of the elements for my home:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stagingetc.com/2011/07/05/staging-westside-home/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17" title="This room is overflowing with gorgeous architectural details" src="http://northwestlivingdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stagingetcWestsideHome-300x196.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></a></p>
<p>Posts to frame and define the room (which is always a challenge with open floor plans). High baseboards to compliment the high ceilings. Detailed moulding in the ceiling with complimentary lighting &#8211; notice not all on the same switch both for energy savings and mood lighting. Framed window all the way to the ceiling that adds interest to the eye, but with perfect balance. The paint is a subtle tone-on-tone to make this room feel light and flow easily with the rest of the home. This space is just perfect.</p>
<p>I was a decorator designer for 4 years as co-owner of Staging Etc located in Vancouver, BC Canada. I&#8217;m now located in Seattle, WA, blissfully married to a loving husband, and have a 5-month old daughter. I&#8217;ve been bit by the design bug again (as is David) and we look forward to sharing our thoughts about everything design!</p>
<p>Peace love and happiness,</p>
<p>Alice and David</p>
