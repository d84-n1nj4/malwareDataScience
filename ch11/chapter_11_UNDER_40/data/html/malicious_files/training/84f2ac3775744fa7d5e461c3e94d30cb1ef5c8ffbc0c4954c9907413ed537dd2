I got the Phelon in the High Vis colorway in a size 10 us. I put them through at least 10 very enjoyable games and am very surprised with how much I looked forward to putting them on each game, I'll find it hard to keep objective in this review but I'll do my best. Nike Employ a very soft (when broken in) synthetic that sports a honey comb/ waffle like pattern that they have dubbed trophy synthetic. The outsole is also designed to work with the natural motion of the foot and has a very decent amount of padding. What is even more impressive is they manage to keep the weight so low. <b>nike hypervenom vs ctr360</b> ,<b>nike hypervenom vs ctr360</b>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/566046246893552756/">Nike Magista Obra FG Rooney 2014 All Black Blackout $101.88</a>

Dani Alves appears to be shopping for a new cleat endorsement after showing up at Barcelona training this week in a blackout pair of cleats. And it looks like Nike is the front-runner or maybe a sentimental favorite with the defender pulling on an old pair of the Mercurial Superfly. Alves was a regular in the Superfly during the 2009/10 campaign. He pulled on various colorways of the cleat before signing a 4-year deal with adidas in 2010 that saw him switch to the F50 adiZero. He became one of the lead faces for the new NitroCharge silo but never really settled in to the cleat designed for the team ‘engine’ and returned to the F50 Battle Pack for the 2014 World Cup. And a return to the Swoosh would make sense with Nike the apparel sponsor for the team and a large number of the players in the brand. What brand do you want to see Alves select? Should he go back to Nike, stick with adidas, or try something new? adidas and Nike cleats are available at WorldSoccerShop.com PUMA released the evoSPEED 1.3 (available here) a couple days after the end of the 2014 World Cup. Since then the boot has been spotted on the feet of several professionals during the European pre-season. It’s also the first choice boot of MLS’ers such as Arsenal and France legend Thierry Henry.
