			<h1>Chairman’s Corner – Issue 20</h1>
<p>Dedicated to the One We Love</p>
<p>Since the AGM and Forum, we have been looking at its format to see if we could improve it and hopefully encourage more residents to come along. The result of our deliberations is that the event will get a complete make‐over for 2012, starting with the name, which will be “Chellaston 2012” reflecting the name of one of the other big events of the year. We are planning an event, in conjunction with Derby City Council, that will be a celebration of what Chellaston has to offer and we are hoping that it will have something for everyone. We will have most of Chellaston clubs and societies demonstrating what they do as well as the City Council and some of its departments, the police, fire brigade, the schools, churches and others who will be giving advice and telling us what they are doing for Chellaston. During the day there will be demonstrations and performances – dance, drama and gymnastics to name but a few, as well as the opportunity to have a go at sports activities with the sports clubs. The school has said they will want residents to see what their pupils have achieved in various fields and refreshments are being provided by the group of students who will be going out to the school’s Uganda project this year, to raise much needed funds. And, oh yes, there will be our AGM as well! The date of Chellaston 2012 is Saturday 17th March and the venue is Chellaston School so please make a note of it in your diary – it will be a big day for our neighbourhood, so help us to make it a success!</p>
<p>The long‐running saga of the Red Lion site may finally be coming to an end as a planning application has been submitted for a housing development on the plot of land currently occupied by the car wash. Regular readers of my musings will know that a residential development was the last thing the CRA wanted for the site, but what is left after Tesco took their area could hardly be used for anything else. Looking at the plans, which can be accessed through the Derby City Council website, the design does at least make an ugly corner somewhat neater even if it is not quite what we envisaged when drawing up our Supplementary Planning Document. The SPD by the way is now with the Planning Department who are working on its final version which will be suitable for adoption by the Council. There is some urgency to this work because of plans being drawn up by the coalition government in its draft National Planning Policy Framework document to relax planning restrictions very considerably and these new guidelines will be used where there is no local plan already in existence. So if we don’t get our SPD approved soon, we will find that developers will have an unrestrained free reign to build what they like. It will become much more difficult to oppose developments such as that proposed for the top of Swarkestone Road whose proposals are totally out of character with surrounding properties.</p>
<p>We have recently had an update on Chellaston Business Park from its developer, Wilson Bowden. It will be built between west Chellaston and the Rolls‐Royce site at Sinfin and the developer has been renewing the outline planning permission previously granted. Progress will depend on the level of interest in the plots being created so it is impossible to give a timescale, but we can say that the developer appeared bullish about his prospects. It won’t however mean that the T12 road will get built straight away as the developer will need to have sold or let a certain number of plots before there will be sufficient funding, but this will give us extra time to make representations about the exact route it will finally take, to see if we can get it moved away from the residential area of west Chellaston. We will report on developments as we hear of them.</p>
<p>At the Neighbourhood Forum last week we had a group of Chellaston younger residents come along to see if we could get a skateboarding area built somewhere in the area. Their case was a strong one – that there is little for their particular age group to do. Their presentation was well thought out and I hope that, in time, some funds can be found to make some provision. What I found particularly refreshing was that the group should have taken the trouble to come along to put their case forward. Young people are generally not represented on the various committees in Chellaston and it would be good if they could have a voice. I am therefore putting this forward as a challenge and would encourage any of our younger residents to come along and let us know what you really think. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
