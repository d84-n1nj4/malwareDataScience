			<p>went out with the origs tonight. ang saya! i&#8217;m happy i get to be with them. though i drank more than my limit but i&#8217;m happy i did it with them. so many unexpected news and plans were made again for another gathering at one of our friend&#8217;s private resort. i didn&#8217;t say no but i&#8217;m not sure if i can go.</p>
<p>i love my friends and the reason why i didn&#8217;t say no with that beach outing next weekend is that i terribly miss them. life is kinda carefree with them. i easily forget everything and i actually have fun because i know that even if i get drunk i know that i&#8217;m actually in good hands with them. i&#8217;m not a drunkard but i do drink to relax and they know that.</p>
<p>it has been more than 2 years since our frequent getaways&#8230; those days i miss terribly because i know that even if i dance till the wee hours of the morning i know that they know where i&#8217;m coming from. they understand the intensity of challenges i face when we don&#8217;t get to be with each other. they don&#8217;t discriminate, do not judge and do not even entertain the tought that i am being bombarded with so much hurdles.</p>
<p>o well&#8230; there goes aga again. he and his gf broke up and, well, everything&#8217;s seems to be a brighter tomorrow as he sees it to be. duh!?! out of context? yup, i just want to bring him up. we were basketball buddies and we&#8217;re both sports enthusiasts and the funny thing is that he thinks i&#8217;m still into F1. whew! that was ages ago. he tried to impress me about things he&#8217;s been doing with. what he doesn&#8217;t know is that i understand him. he doesn&#8217;t need to exert his best effort to make me understand.  i do get him. i really do.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m drunk. i know. i just want to wake up tomorrow thinking that i&#8217;m stupid enough to write this. i miss them&#8230; i let the waiter took picture of us because when i leave, i have something to look at. shit! i don&#8217;t even want to think about it. i miss them already and looking forward to the next weekend. they want me to plan it again because i get everyone to show up? maybe! panic mode. i don&#8217;t now what to to expect. they told me to relax and just think of fun. hey, i&#8217;m an eldest child. it&#8217;s my nature to be conscious about so many things. o well&#8230; love them still&#8230;. i don&#8217;t make sense and it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>isn&#8217;t it obvious? i miss them terribly that it makes me cry now.</p>

			<p>why is everyone so uptight lately? </p>
<p>i was awaken with a frantic shove from my mother and my grandmother&#8217;s caregiver. reason? lola&#8217;s catheter was removed. this thing happened in the past and i don&#8217;t understand why they still get uptight about it. </p>
<p>when i went to the kitchen to request for breakfast, my father was busily mumbling about something. i asked the maid what it was about. we ran out of tapas. what?!? but there are other foods in there, i thought. i told him there&#8217;s still chorizo. that made him relax a bit.</p>
<p>i then got a call from my aunt. she wants to order a wheelchair for the mayor. this raised my eyebrow. okay. i don&#8217;t like him. and she wants it pronto. he may be the mayor but first things first especially when i know that i won&#8217;t be earning from this one. mean? no. we just had numerous biddings which we won that weren&#8217;t awarded to us because he favors someone else. now why would i ever give him that special treatment? because he is the mayor? oh no. no, no, no and no. i told my aunt to wait. she raised her voice. i told her to relax. we have no stocks on hand. i have to order it. </p>
<p>last night was something too. i was having a conversation with someone. i asked him if he wants to hear the truth because i don&#8217;t want to explain and when i do, there is no stopping me. the truth hurts most of the time. maybe that&#8217;s the reason why i was left on the air all alone. </p>
<p>uptight? yes. </p>

			<p>randomness&#8230;</p>
<p>it&#8217;s late. i just got home from a dinner which was really last minute. i had our maid cooked some food for me only to be left uneaten because my best friend, RHY, fetched me. i didn&#8217;t hesitate to go since i was thinking that i might leave anytime and i won&#8217;t be able to spend more time with my friends.</p>
<p>when we reached the restobar owned by &#8220;little brother&#8221; from school, there were only 2 of them there yet. we ordered for dinner and a pitcher of margarita. ahhh&#8230; i needed a little alcohol to loosen up some tension. i&#8217;m not much of a drinker lately. i just choose to have margarita to sustain a sane talk with them.</p>
<p>we talked about our friend mike and his gf (ex?) pat. we&#8217;re not sure what really happened on why after almost like 10 years in relationship everything ended up in break up. no one could figure out why and what really transpired but then, mike is our friend and we decided to stand by him&#8230;no matter what&#8230; just imagine more than 20 years of friendship.. we don&#8217;t take sides&#8230; we just think that mike needs us now more than anything else. anyway, we all hope that he&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>another news. another friend is engaged and that&#8217;s the main reason why we had this dinner again. they&#8217;re not sure yet when the exact date will be but we&#8217;re happy that our friend si happy. i don&#8217;t know why but the group has become so conscious about the major decisions that each friend had made. we asked her if she&#8217;s really ready for the marriage. no other expressions or explanation and the answer was a big yes with a big smile. that was enough to convince everyone that there is no doubt.</p>
<p>then we all raised our glasses for happiness and serenity and wished that everyone who are not yet married and are planning to get hitched will find the same goal&#8230;. to have a happy marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;little brother&#8221; arrived and of course, i still get the big hug and a beso on my cheek. it has always been that way. we adore each other and couldn&#8217;t find any bad bone from one another. i don&#8217;t really know how it became that way&#8230; i mean our relationship. he&#8217;s really heaven and i&#8217;m just earth. he&#8217;s into social scene and i&#8217;m just the girl at the sides. yet we still have that common ground and that is respect and love for each other.</p>
<p>one friend mentioned that a friend of mine from another group is kinda tied up with another girl right now. that made me think and texted another of our group, origs. he asked for reunion and i obliged. his other request is that no partners allowed. so it will be members only.. no girlfriend and no boyfriends should be present&#8230; not a problem with me. so i texted everyone and somehow and some way everyone is excited especially with the idea that they will be going alone. tsk! tsk! lucky them&#8230; they will have us as their dates. LOL! i&#8217;m sure it will still end up with lotsa jokes and tsismis. sidelines? not allowed!</p>
<p>anyway, gotta sleep. it&#8217;s late and i feel the margarita pushing me to rest. it has been a busy week. i hope next week will be okay.</p>
<p>hasta luego, mi amigos! adios!</p>

<p>i am just not in the mood to say anything now. i just want to stare at a blank space and let my brain go numb. i am tired. i guess i&#8217;m just tired.</p>
<p>i just came back from a meeting and everything went well&#8230; more than what i expected actually. i wish all meetings will be like the one we had awhile ago instead of the ones that require interventions because of the never ending problems&#8230;</p>
<p>my friend went with me to that meeting. while we were on our way, she kept on complaining about what she saw on tv&#8230; according to her, UP graduates had their graduation ceremony in PICC and at the end of their graduation, some had placards asking for the ouster of the president. truthfully speaking, i really hate paying taxes only to be spent to students who are ungrateful. yes, they do pay a part of their tuition but it&#8217;s government subsidized. where do the government get their money? from us, people who pay taxes. i&#8217;m not quite satisfied with the way things are with them. you send them to school only to rebel? i don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the solution for this country. opting for a rally or honking horns are the least ways for problems to be solved.</p>
<p>i just found out someone close to us is on drugs&#8230; i couldn&#8217;t believe how he would choose to be like that. he can&#8217;t even sustain himself&#8230; oh well&#8230; people do sometimes make stupid choices</p>
<p>i thought i can rest tomorrow. a friend sent me a text message that tomorrow will be the start of the new season for the interbatch alumni competition in our alma mater. we are such loyal alumni and supportive batchmates. we, the cheerleaders, have our own uniform to be worn during the games of our batchmates and we started it last year just for fun. i&#8217;m sure other batches are bound to follow our footsteps. i just hope that this time we will have the chance to be, at least, included in the semi-finals and not be eliminated easily.</p>
<p>the camera is still not here and i&#8217;m really getting anxious about it. i have long been wanting to study photography and while it&#8217;s not here, i&#8217;m just stuck reading materials related to it. my friend, ton, has been urging me to start shooting already so that we can both exchange ideas.</p>
<p>i just remembered something. my mother and i had a good laugh while my brother was explaining to us that he wants to join his friends playing airsoft. i told him that if he&#8217;s really determined to join and buy the needed gears, he should tell me so that we can ask my friend (who&#8217;s into it also and is selling those stuff) for a special price. our father told him about the tactics that he thinks would be good to follow. one thing he mentioned was that my brother should be physically fit because there will be running and jumping or whatever there is to do. my father then suddenly asked him if he&#8217;s really decided. he told my brother that he will be easily shot since he&#8217;s a big guy and his silhoutte will always reveal that it&#8217;s really him. lance and ahmed are not into it (and they are as big as him), the rest of their friends are quite small. my brother just scratched his head and laughed. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">napaisip tuloy si mokong kung anong gear ang  pwedeng maging invisible sya.</span></p>
<p>when will i ever have that vacation that is purely vacation? one that i will just lie down and stare at the stars and hear the sweet sound of waves or just bathe myself in the sun while staring loosely to the sea&#8230;.hmmmm&#8230; maybe i should ask for a few days off&#8230; next week my aunt will be here and has been asking me to go to their beach. i should go with her provided that i will not be pestered with questions on how to improve the place or the island. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">gusto ko lang talaga tumunganga.</span></p>
<p>i&#8217;m currently reading FOR ONE MORE DAY by MITCH ALBOM. i started reading it this afternoon while the electricity was out and i couldn&#8217;t do anything related to work. i think this one will be a good read just like Mitch Albom&#8217;s other books.</p>
<p>i miss the vampires. i hope that there will be another pictorial these coming days. it&#8217;s always fun and i always experience relief when i&#8217;m with them.</p>
<p>i do miss the boyfriend too. he&#8217;s been very busy and so am i. i hope things will be okay soon with my application so that we will be able to finalize everything.  i will be adding some burden to him in the next few days for the presentation that i needed to do. he will not say no but i know that it will be an added load for him. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">syempre hindi talaga sya makaayaw kasi 2,000 words per minute ang maririnig nya. in fairness, OC yun sa design kaya hindi rin aayaw.</span> one good thing about us now is that we encourage each other in terms of personal development as well as in our careers. no more fights and that is quite a relief.</p>
<p>and by the way, i got intruiged by the young guys living just across us. hhhmmmm&#8230; mukhang mga gwapisimo at ang gaganda ng katawan. kainis! alam ko mainit pero sana hwag naman nila expose katawan nila kasi baka bigla na lang ako magkaamnesia at makalimutan ko na lang boypren ko. pero hindi rin&#8230; <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">sabay ganun</span>.</p>
<p>i feel sleepy. my mind&#8217;s not working. to shawie, doo bidoo.. hahahahha! nakita ko si twinks kagina. bwahahaha! syempre, kalbo and yummy body pa rin. haaay&#8230; kasi naman eh&#8230; ang bata! i hope you get to see angel too wherever he is. i saw jonathan and portia yesterday at the review center. syempre we talked about that nonsense girl jima. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">pinangalanan pa eh.</span> nonsense naman talaga. and yes, they hired me to do the rationalization and eventually be a lecturer. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ano naman kaya ang ituro ko? baka manguna pa ako sa katarantaduhan.</span> applying for that job was not really intentional. my friend gave my resume to that review center. i guess i just want to kill myself with more work. haay&#8230; sideline! at least it will be during my convenient time with topics of my choice. spoiled no?</p>
<p>i guess that&#8217;s all folks. hasta maniana!</p>
