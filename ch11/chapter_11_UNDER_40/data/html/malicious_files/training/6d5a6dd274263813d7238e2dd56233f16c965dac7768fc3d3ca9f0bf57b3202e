If you still go to Corso San Maurizio you can see those lights because           in Torino, they still believe in angels, you know. These are angels.           It was very nice but very dark. <br>          <i>Are you a Catholic?</i> <br>          Not at all. I don't have really an official religion but I believe and           pray sometimes.

I took it because most           of the time, all these are Europeans and when I go to the meetings,           I often find that I am the only foreigner. Foreigner from Africa, woman...           <br>          And, you know, they start to talk about all the dog shit on the street.,           They invited me to give them my point of view. I told them that I'm           very sorry, I come from another country, I can't understand your relationship           with the dogs, I don't understand why don't you have babies instead           of dogs, you know. I can't give comments because my point of view is           that dogs should stay in their place, you know, like in my country in           Africa, the dogs don't come in the house, the dogs stay out, you don't           cook for the dog, the dog goes to look for food, you know. So I was           telling them that and they said 'ah, we know who doesn't like dogs'           and I said 'I like dogs', but they stay at their post. <br>          <i>What other questions was the meeting about?</i> <br>          They want it to become redeveloped to a European level, you know and           it's also to give help to people who are a bit left behind in society,           people who don't have a job qualification, who only know how to do some           manual work. So they help to send them to schools. Also they are talking           about redeveloping the estate because it's very degraded. Everybody's           there, hoping that something will happen to their estate, to their houses           or to their building, you know.<br>          <br>          <br>          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="3"></a><a href="pic03_e.html" target="pic">3</a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>          <br>          </font></p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last years the city           is always breaking down and they're building things they're building           walls, and this is the wall near the Sinagogue in Via Sant Anselmo,           but it's so ugly and it doesn't save or solve anything - I don't know           for what reason they're doing this, and you can see there's dust in           the air because they're still breaking down places, but the city is           still very grey and boring but they're still building, building but           nothing changes.

Dog piss, or           maybe human piss, I don't know who does this pissing.

I wasn't supposed to take this one, I went to           ask first in another shop which is nearby. I asked them if I could take           a picture, they sent me away in a really bad way, you know. But they           have very good photos of hairstyles from Africa, but when they sent           me away I went to my friend, she has the same shop, with a bit less           beautiful hair design, so I thought it's okay for me and she let me           take the photo. Both shops are run by Africans. It's a pity 'cos the           other one had very nice window displays.

You don't know what I wanted to take here. I wanted to take           the police because they appeared first in the mirror that I had thrown           away and i thought that even the police would be better just to be thrown           away. Because the police are there all the time, but as I was taking           it they were really looking at me, like 'what does she want to do?',           so I said, okay, then I'm gonna take the tower that was very nice, too.</font><br>          <br>          <br>          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="8"></a><a href="pic08_e.html" target="pic">8</a>           </font> </p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>          This is the view I see every time when I come home.

And i arrived in Milano then took           a train to come to Torino, because I had to come to Torino and these           are the tracks that I used to come to Torino on. And now here I am again,           living next to the tracks, but now I look at it through the fence -           then I said to myself, Mamma mia, I didn't know when I was coming that           I came to be in a prison. I mean, I could leave, but I can't leave all           these things (shows around her) alone. </font><br>          <br>        </p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="9"></a><a href="pic09_e.html" target="pic">9</a>           </font><br>          <br>        </p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is my travel agency           where I go to book my flight when I have to travel, so I give them a           lot of money and nothing changes, the wall is just the same.

I don't really like to go far away to arrange my things because           when I have to travel, I go very far, so if I can get my ticket near           here, I can go very far away with it.<br>          <br>          </font></p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="10"></a><a href="pic10_e.html" target="pic">10<br>          <br>          <br>          </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My good neighbour.           She doesn't give me peace in my house. This time she wasn't on the balcony,           okay, I thought, this time maybe I can steal something from her. Because           anything of mine that falls down to her balcony - you know I'm not very           careful - I never get it back. She's stolen my best T-shirt this way.           So I used the camera to steal something from her: an image. <br>          <br>          <br>          <a name="11"></a><a href="pic11_e.html" target="pic">11<br>          <br>          <br>          </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is when the           mirror broke. What happened is that I was cleaning the whole shop and           cleaned the mirror too, the windows from outside and then someone called           me for some urgent reason so I had to stop cleaning the mirror. So I           went to see why they'd called me. Five minutes later I came back and           found that the mirror had fallen down and broken. How did it happen?           You know, in Torino they are very superstitious, you know, Torino is           a magical city. It's true, I can prove it 'cos I've lived here, because           everything goes very well, you think everything is nice, but something           will come up, you know, and you'll have to start again from the beginning           because something gets spoiled. It's like the routine. So I thought,           well, this mirror is broken, that means seven years of bad luck in the           superstition, but maybe this mirror can give me seven years of luck.           Because it reflected my shop. When I arrived back I found my shop upside-down,           you know? Broken.. and there was the arc doubled.<br>          <br>          </font><br>          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="12"></a><a href="pic12_e.html" target="pic">12<br>          <br>          <br>          </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I took this, 'cos           I thought it might be photogenic.

And you see these two eyes pointing out, you know. Accessories,           look... you know. Wait, I got it. It's very improtant. It reminds me           of a not very happy period that I spent in hospital. And in the hospital           there was the same sign. Because of the wheelchairs. So I had a very           terrible time in hospital and, when I saw this, it brought me back to           those times.
