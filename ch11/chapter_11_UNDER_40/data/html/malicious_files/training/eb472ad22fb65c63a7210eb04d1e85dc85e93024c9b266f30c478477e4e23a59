			<h1>Developments and Growth Strategies</h1>
<p>New housing developments are always controversial, but Chellaston appears to be "developers' paradise", with applications for planning permission presently coming one after another.</p>
<p>Both Derby City and South Derbyshire County Councils are formulating their plans to deliver tens of thousands of homes throughout their areas, many of which will be in or around Chellaston. Their Preferred Growth Strategy documents were out for public consultation until 21st December 2012. From these, the Draft Local Plans have been developed and published in September and October of 2013.</p>
<p>Below is an outline of the salient points from the two documents. The documents only consider the large developments. Residents are advised to refer to the main documents (links below), which include the maps. It is worth noting that the existing west Chellaston estate consists of approximately 1000 dwellings. This puts the proposals into perspective.</p>
<p>The documents are split in to preferred and non-preferred sites. Many of these sites have already been granted planning permission. Where main areas of concern are listed, these may include CRA comments.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Preferred sites:</h3>
<p><strong>Chellaston Fields – around 500 dwellings</strong></p>
<p><img src="/cra2/images/planning/chellaston_fields.png" border="0" alt="" /><br /><strong>Outline planning permission was given by South Derbyshire planning committee in November 2013</strong></p>
<p>This site lies within South Derbyshire and is to the east of the A514, between the edge of Chellaston and the A50. The site is described as “a prominent greenfield extension to Chellaston”. Changes made in October2013 include the provision of a primary school and removal of the petrol station and 50 car parking spaces. Due to the addition of the school, the open land is reduced by around 1.1ha.</p>
<p>Main areas of concern are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant constraints on both primary and secondary school places in the area. Derby City Council is "considering a coordinated approach to the provision of primary and secondary school places with the County Council and South Derbyshire District Council. This may include pooling pupil requirements from sites adjoining the urban edge of Chellaston where their cumulative impact would require additional school places."</li>
<li>The provision of a safe and satisfactory access to the site is described as 'challenging'.</li>
<li>Will have a significant impact on the junction of the A50/A514.</li>
<li>Loss of greenfield site and wildlife.</li>
<li>Extends Chellaston to the A50</li>
<li>Monies will go to SDDC, but the burden will be put on overstretched resources within Chellaston.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Woodlands Lane – around 60 dwellings</strong></p>
<p><img src="/cra2/images/planning/woodlandslane.png" border="0" alt="" /><br /> <strong>This site was granted outline planning permission by Derby City Council on 20 June 2013</strong></p>
<p>This site will provide a minimum of 56 new homes. Access will be from Woodlands Lane.</p>
<p>Main areas of concern are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure on school places at primary and secondary level in and around Chellaston.</li>
<li>Access to the site –pressure on existing roads</li>
<li>Increased risk of flooding</li>
<li>Loss of greenfield and wildlife.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Boulton Moor – around 2800 dwellings</strong></p>
<p><img src="/cra2/images/planning/BoultonMoor.png" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 has been granted outline planning permission by SDDC. Derby City site: Planning permission applied for.</strong></p>
<p>This cross boundary site will provide 2,748 new homes at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boulton Moor in Derby City – 800 dwellings</li>
<li>Boulton Moor Phase 1 in South Derbyshire (for which outline planning permission exists) – 1058 dwellings</li>
<li>Boulton Moor Phase 2 in South Derbyshire – 700 dwellings</li>
<li>Boulton Moor Phase 3 in South Derbyshire – 190 dwellings</li>
</ul>
<p>NB: This excludes a proposed development of 200 dwellings, off Fellow Lands Way, which is shown as a ‘potential site’ in the document and is detailed in another part of this document.</p>
<p>Principal access points will be onto Snelsmoor Lane and secondary accesses will be onto Sevenlands Drive and Field Lane, Alvaston.</p>
<p>Public open space will be sought both within the site and off site as improvements to the remaining Green Wedge within the city.</p>
<p>As part of a sustainable approach to managing surfacewater and flood risk, development will be expected to address issues with existing water courses.</p>
<p>Development will progress from both the western and eastern ends to a comprehensive masterplan to create a new community that also recognises the longer term potential for further growth to the south well beyond 2028 as set out in South Derbyshire’s Preferred Growth Strategy.</p>
<p>A new primary school will be provided on the Boulton Moor Phase 1 site to serve this and the Phase II site. A new primary will also be required on the site within the City. Pupils from Boulton Moor Phase 1 site will be accommodated at the new Noel-Baker school. Potential for extensions to this School will be explored to provide secondary education places.</p>
<p>Main areas of concern are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sites are within the Boulton Moor Green Wedge, a large proportion of which will be lost</li>
<li>A site to the south of the proposed areas is currently divorced from the urban area, but could become part of wider strategic extension to Derby when the Conjoined Inquiry site in South Derbyshire is developed. This site could accommodate a further 2100 dwellings.</li>
<li>None of the sites is within easy reach of local services and facilities.</li>
<li>The development of the sites will have an impact on the local and strategic road network, including the A52 and A50. The current problems with the High Street /A514 junction will be made considerably worse with rat-running along St Peter’s Road and Glenwood Road.</li>
<li>The developments will cause secondary education issues, but should not impact on Chellaston schools.</li>
<li>There is a Site of Special Scientific Interest in the centre of the Boulton Moor Green Wedge.</li>
<li>The sites are presently grade 3 agriculture land.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Land off Holmleigh Way – around 160 dwellings</strong></p>
<p><strong>This site was granted planning permission in January 2014</strong></p>
<p>This site lies to the south and west of the existing west Chellaston development and would be bounded on its western side by the former canal. Access will be from the roundabout at Holmleigh Way. Landscaped buffers will be required to ensure that homes are set back from the frontage of Holmleigh Way and to screen them from the A50 to the south.</p>
<p>The site will provide about 160 dwellings, 50 within the City and 110 in South Derbyshire. Comprehensive approval to the development of the two parts of this site will be required. As a smaller strategic site, it could deliver housing in the short term.</p>
<p>Main areas of concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is pressure on school places at primary and secondary level in and around Chellaston.</li>
<li>Some areas at risk of pluvial flooding.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Land North of Fellow Lands Way – around 200 dwellings</strong></p>
<p><strong>This site was granted full planning permission by Derby City Council on 9th November 2013</strong></p>
<p>The site is not included in the Preferred Growth Strategy, but appeared in the Draft Local Plan as an allocated site.</p>
<p>This site lies on the south east edge of the built up area of Derby, on the north-eastern edge of Chellaston and is made up of land within the Boulton Moor Green Wedge. The site lies to the north west of Chellaston Park and is currently made up of the complex of buildings at Boulton Edge Farm and adjoining agricultural fields with hedgerow and tree field boundaries. The southern section of the site is level, before gently sloping away to the north and north east. A public footpath runs through the centre of the site, heading in a northerly direction from the end of Back Lane.</p>
<p>The site lies on the opposite side of the wedge to the potential strategic allocation at Boulton/Thulston. This broad location is made up of 4 individual sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boulton Moor (east) within the City (800 dwellings)</li>
<li>Land at Boulton Moor, off Shardlow Road that received permission for 1,058 dwellings at the conjoined Inquiry</li>
<li>An extension to the aforementioned permission site which bridges the gap between the permission site and the site within the City (700 dwellings)</li>
</ul>
<p>Main areas of concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site has been the subject of consideration at previous local plan inquiries, where inspectors have resisted its allocation on green wedge grounds. The Green Wedge Study (2012) concludes that a more limited extent of development than has previously been proposed may be acceptable, subject to adjustments to the sites boundary and providing a defensible edge to the green wedge</li>
<li>Existing primary and secondary schools are large and at capacity. The site on its own would not sustain a new primary and would be problematic brought forward in isolation. In terms of secondary schools, Chellaston Academyl is already over capacity and has limited capacity for expansion. There is availability at some other local Derby schools which could help meet this shortfall.</li>
<li>Development using the local Chellaston road network will add to congestion at the junction of High Street and A514, which already has significant capacity issues, and will have an impact on St Peter’s Road and Glenwood Road.</li>
<li>Boulton Moor Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) lies directly north of the site. This is a geological designation.</li>
<li>The site lies wholly within the Boulton Moor green wedge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Background to rejection of previous planning application:</p>
<p>City of Derby Local Plan Review Inspector, in not allocating the site, stated that “I consider that the most serious objection to the allocation of this site for housing is the manner in which the site protrudes into a generally flat and somewhat featureless agricultural landscape. It has built development on only one side and despite established hedgerows, and lack of significant distant views of the site, housing development would have a serious visual impact on the rural aspect of this part of Derby.</p>
<p>Although there is an ever presence of existing housing, further northerly encroachment would be poorly related to existing urban form. The need for major structural landscaping, envisaged by the Objector, to filter the outline of development is an indication of the inherent unsuitability of the site. The loss of some potentially higher grade agricultural land is a further drawback.”</p>
<p>In addition, in commenting on the removal of the land from the Green Wedge, the Inspector made clear that “Removal would interrupt the flow of greenery into and around strong boundaries of urban form and there would be every indication of housing spewing north-eastwards. Whilst the wedge is generous in width, this is a function of topography and landscape character. Removal would be to an arbitrary boundary, which would, in turn, require significant reinforcement. The new boundaries would not fulfil the underlying criteria for green wedge definition.”</p>
<p>He therefore concluded that “The impact on the green wedge would be severe due to the notable lack of visual containment and I conclude that the site should not be allocated”.</p>
<p>The Green Wedge Study concludes that “there may be some potential for a limited amount of new development on the southern side of the Green Wedge, subject to appropriate landscape treatment and appropriate location behind the ridge line and park boundary”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lowes Farm – around 1000 dwellings</strong></p>
<p>Lowes Farm lies to the west of the A514 off Holmleigh Way and has become a ‘reserved’ site within the SDDC plan and could deliver around 1000 dwellings. The site is predominantly agricultural fields with a shooting club contained to the west of the site.</p>
<p>The site is contained by the A50 the south, the former Derby Canal which is currently used as a pedestrian and cycle trail abuts the earner boundary of the site and the Global Technology Cluster (proposed within Derby City’s Preferred Growth Strategy) is located to the north west of the site. To the west lies open countryside, though part is suggested as a strategic location for the future expansion of the Global Technology Cluster.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Non-preferred sites</h3>
<p>Although these sites are 'non-preferred', there is still significant interest from developers.</p>
<p><strong>Thulston Fields – around 2,100 dwellings</strong></p>
<p>This is a very substantial Green Belt site to the south east of Derby and, as such, enjoys particularly strong protection under the National Planning Policy Framework. It lies immediately to the south of Boulton Moor Phase 1 at Boulton Moor, which already has planning permission but is yet to start, and would be contained to the south and east by the A50 and A6 spur trunk roads. The site is separated from Chellaston to the west by open countryside.</p>
<p>As well as leading to the loss of Green Belt land, development here could risk blocking off the mouth of a Green Wedge designated in the City of Derby Local Plan Review. The site is therefore not being preferred for development in the Preferred Growth Strategy. However, this consultation does invite views on whether this area of land ought to be allocated as “safeguarded” Green Belt land – to be considered exceptionally to meet long term development needs well beyond the current plan period to 2028.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p><strong> Land to the South of Woodlands Lane Site – around 64 dwellings</strong></p>
<div id="content-left" style="width: 30%;"><img src="/cra2/images/planning/notice.png" border="0" alt="" /></div>
<div id="content-right" style="width: 70%;">
<p>Included in the City compendium, but interestingly not in the SDDC paperwork. Site reference S0174 adjoins the Woodlands Lane site to the north and the Chellaston Fields site to the west and south. At a recent Neighbourhood Forum, the owners, Hallam Land Management said that they have no intention of developing the land. However, a Derbyshire County Council document says: “The site is considered achievable as it is a green field site and there is a reasonable prospect that the site will be financially viable for residential development in the future.” In addition, Hallam Land Management has erected signs around the perimeter of the site stating their ownership of the land.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Global Technology Cluster (Now known as Infinity Park)</h3>
<p><strong>Full planning permission for the T12 road was granted Aug 2013</strong></p>
<p>A Global Technology Cluster, now known as Infinity Park, sited to the west of Chellaston, on Sinfin Moor has already been given the go-ahead. Initially covering 90ha the ‘business park’ will be bigger than Pride Park. A new road, known as the T12, will be grafted on to the end of Holmleigh Way to feed the park. This has angered residents along the existing road, who fear that the potential HGV traffic will adversely affect their lives, although Planners claim that HGV traffic will be less than in previous plans.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the plans for development to the south of Holmleigh Way are requiring ‘landscaped buffers to ensure that homes are set back from the frontage of Holmleigh Way.’ The existing residents are being offered nothing to mitigate the disturbance.</p>
<p>There may be potential to extend the proposed business park southwards across the South Derbyshire administrative boundary towards the A50. The area within South Derbyshire would potentially measure some 30 hectares. Any such extension would be dependent upon the provision of suitable road access, public transport and measures to prevent flooding in consultation with Derby City Council and the developers of the remainder of the site to the north. Development here could provide a logical expansion of the site and balance proposed housing development to the south of Derby, helping to meet the employment needs of South Derbyshire residents. However, it is unlikely that land in this location would come forward before substantial progress had been made in developing the remainder of the site within Derby and it would not therefore be expected to be developed until the latter part of the plan period at the earliest.</p>
