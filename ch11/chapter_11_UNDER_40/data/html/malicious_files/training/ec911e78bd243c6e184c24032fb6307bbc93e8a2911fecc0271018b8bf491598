			<p>The country of culture and heritage, “Portugal”, is a country rich in old monuments. These monuments are the classical example of the Portuguese architecture (as in San Fins Portugal and in nearby cities). These monuments are the marks of those people who have conquered the land and settled here. The most important names here are Romans, Germans, Suebians, Arabs and Visigoths. These monuments are also influenced by the Europeans arts and architectural styles. These styles include Romanesque, Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic.</p>
<p>There are 11 periods of Portuguese architecture. First period is pre-Roman period. In this period, Megaliths and Celtic villages were built. Next period was the Roman period. In this period, many buildings were built including the Roman Temple of Evora. The best preserved of Roman period of architecture in Portugal are Conimbriga near Coimbra and Mirobriga near Santiago (both with the well preserved city, buildings, walls, baths and temples). Most people don&#8217;t know that Portugal is a country where many people like to participate in gambling. The betting and casino industry has grown increasingly in popularity over the Internet. Along with craps, poker, blackjack, keno, and pokies the online casino has paved a way for gamblers to participate in gambling on table games and also sports betting. the casino also allows users to avoid certain laws that regulate normal casinos. Because of the increase in popularity of gambling and <a href="http://www.australianbetting.org/gambling-online/">gambling online</a> there are now many sites that offer casino reviews. The sites that offer casino reviews often explain exactly how the online casino sites function. The online casino reviews act as a way for new players to decide where to best place their money and get the best payouts. For the best information related to gambling and sports betting we recommend you visit <a href="http://www.australianbetting.org/">www.AustralianBetting.org</a>.</p>
<p>Next comes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Germany">Germanic period of architecture</a>. In this period, the German people invaded the region in about 500 AD. One of the buildings of German era includes Saint Frutuose Chapel which is located near Braga in 7<sup>th</sup> century AD.</p>
<p>After the Germanic period, here comes the Moorish period. In this period, the most important buildings built were Castles and Mosques especially in San Fins Portugal. This period is dominated by the Muslims and thus the mosques and Islamic castles are the most important buildings.</p>
<p>Romanesque style architecture comes between 1100 and 1230 BC. In this era, Cathedrals and monasteries were the main focus of the people. The most important one are the Church of Benedictine Monastery of Rates (decorated with zoomorphic as well as anthropomorphic decorations in 1096 AD), old Cathedral of Coimbra (constructed in 1162 AD) and the Almourol Castle (built in 1171) which is the highest tower in the keep of castle.</p>
<p>In the Gothic period from 1200 to 1450 AD, Churches, Monasteries, castles and palaces were built. The Manueline period ranges from 1490 to 1520 AD. The architecture of this era were characterized in the honor of King Manuel I. In Renaissance and Mannerism period (1520 to 1650), the architecture was influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_architecture">French architecture</a>. Church of Our Lady of Grace, Cathedral of Mirando do Douro and St. Anton’s Church in Evora are a few examples.</p>
<p>Between 1640 and 1717 AD, there came restoration architecture. In this era, realizations were made which include Jacome Mendes (the Church of Nossa Senhora), the <a href="http://www.metropolasia.com/Macau-attractions/St-Augustine-Square">Church of St. Agostinho</a> and the Church of Portimao.</p>
<p>Between 1717 and 1755 AD, the Baroque style architecture came in vogue. The important constructions of this era were palace of Quetuz, Aguas Livres aqueduct and Opera do Tejo. Here, the most important building was St. John the Baptiste chapel. Then came the Pombaline style (from 1755 to 1860 AD) when the earthquake, tsunami and fire destroyed a number of buildings. Finally, the modern architecture arouses. Pancho Guedes, School of Porto and University of Porto are the main examples. This architecture is progressing day and night.</p>
