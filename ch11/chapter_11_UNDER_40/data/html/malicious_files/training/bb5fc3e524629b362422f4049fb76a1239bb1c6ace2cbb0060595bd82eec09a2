<p>On Monday, September 26th we held a community screening of <em>Sex+Money</em> in Sioux Falls, South Dakota at the Avera Education Center. There were a lot of graduate students from the Masters of Social Work Program at University of South Dakota, so it was a crowd that will most likely come into contact with the most vulnerable populations of their communities.  The panel after the film included South Dakota Senator Joni Cutler, the main sponsor of the Senate Bill that made human trafficking a crime in South Dakota; Elizabeth Talbot, the Director of the Masters of Social Work program at University of South Dakota, who has spent many years of her life researching human trafficking; Ashley, a representative of <a href="http://www.befree58.org/" target="_blank">Be Free Ministries</a>, an organization that works with victims of trafficking in the Sioux Falls area; and Chris Mathew, the Director of Program Development for <a href="http://www.godschild.org/" target="_blank">The GOD&#8217;S CHILD Project</a> and its human trafficking program, <a href="http://www.itemp.org/" target="_blank">The Institute for Trafficked, Exploited, &amp; Missing Persons</a> (ITEMP).  While many people might disregard South Dakota when thinking of sex trafficking, panelists reminded the audience that even in their rural state, sex trafficking is still a serious issue.  With the tourism generated by hunting, and the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, not to mention the constant flow of homeless/runaway youth passing through on Interstate 90, unfortunately sex trafficking is flourishing in South Dakota.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sexandmoneyfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0877.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-273" title="IMG_0877" src="http://blog.sexandmoneyfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0877.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="840" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Panel discussion in Sioux Falls, SD.)</p>
<p>Even though in the last year South Dakota passed legislation to make human trafficking illegal, they had difficulty in passing a more specific Safe Harbor law that would have identified any prostituted person under 16 years of age as a victim, rather than a criminal.  Mathew noted how even if Safe Harbor laws were passed, as it stands now there would not be enough services in place (basic necessities like shelter and beds…) to care for the victims.  He went on to say that the Midwest and Plains states are in need of more groups like Be Free Ministries, who make themselves available for those who might escape from lives of commercial sexual exploitation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Panel Discussion at University of Nebraska.)</p>
<p>On Friday September 30th, we shared our film at University of Nebraska as part of <a href="http://humantrafficking.unl.edu/" target="_blank">The 2011 Interdisciplinary Conference on Human Trafficking</a> that ran from September 29th through October 1st. After the film, the panel included many of the same people who served on the panel at Iowa State University a few weeks before: US Attorney Stephen Patrick O’Meara, Detective John Focht from Council Bluffs Police Department, and an FBI Special Agent.  Additionally we were honored to have Siddharth Kara sit in on the panel.  With 11 years (and counting) of self-financed research on global human trafficking, Mr. Kara is the first Fellow on Human Trafficking at Harvard University&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government.  He has also authored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Trafficking-Inside-Business-Slavery/dp/0231139608" target="_blank"><em>Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Day Slavery</em></a>, and is in the process of writing another book on similar subject matter.  Mr. Kara shares his knowledge throughout our film, and his insight has been extremely helpful, as he is a strong believer in the necessity of creating an informed abolitionist movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Siddharth Kara.)</p>
<p>In the discussion, it was clear that even though there is a constant need for greater cohesion in the anti-trafficking movement, US Attorney O’Meara, Detective Focht, and the Special Agent showed at least a glimpse of what can happen in our country when groups of Cialis drug online <a href="http://www.canadianpharmacy365.net/product/cialis-generic/">http://www.canadianpharmacy365.net/product/cialis-generic/</a> in our communities.  Regarding the different forces that would motivate the profiteers behind sex trafficking, Mr. Kara said, “Erectile dysfunction treating with generic Cialis.”  Furthermore, Kara called for our law enforcement to “bring cost and risk to bear against the offenders.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(The Badlands in South Dakota.)</p>
<p>Over the weekend, as we headed towards Bozeman, Montana for an event at Montana State University on Monday, we were blessed to pass through the beautiful country in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.  We made some quick stops at Mt. Rushmore, Crazy Horse, Old Faithful, and observed different animals we saw along the roads within Yellowstone.  It would have been great to explore the beautiful reserve of land and wildlife more extensively, but we’ll just need to return for more sightseeing when we aren’t under the constraints of a tight schedule.</p>

<p>By the time Monday, October 3rd, came around, it was time to screen the film at Montana State University, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/" target="_blank">Amnesty International </a>student group on their campus.  After the film, the narrators (this author included) all served on a panel to field audience questions about trafficking.  Many of our past panel experiences have felt awkward; but thankfully, Monday’s panel was significantly more natural.   Though we still feel like we have a lot to learn, we were confident in passing along the information, stories, and concepts that have helped us in our own personal journeys of learning how to combat sex trafficking in the US.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Autumn, Tim, Sarah-Jo, Scott, and Morgan serving on the panel at Montana State University in Bozeman.)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, October 4th, we drove a ways up the road from Bozeman to show the film at <a href="http://www.meadowviewchurch.net/MVCC/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Meadow View Community Church</a> in Missoula, Montana.  The church is already aware of domestic minor sex trafficking, as they’ve partnered with Pat McCollough, the former President of the restoration home highlighted in our film, <a href="http://streetlightphx.com/" target="_blank">Streetlight Phoenix</a>.  Meadow View had already heard information and stories from Mr. McCollough, and other former victims who have come to speak at the church with him; so in a way our film served as a supplement to what they already know of this challenge in our country.  Talking to members of the congregation, it was burdensome to hear the stories of past abuses (as we hear with most groups,) but it was uplifting to hear how even formerly-hurting people in their church are learning to move on to a place of reaching out and helping others in their area who are still desperate to have their own stories salvaged.</p>

<p>Our time in Michigan proved to be restful as well as constructive.  Between walks in the forest and wiffleball, a few of us also took some time to help our hosts with some wood splitting.  Before leaving Michigan, the IJM student group at University of Michigan, hosted a screening of Sex+Money on Monday, September 12th.  Afterwards panelists Julie Redmer, a board member of <a href="http://warinternational.org/" target="_blank">Women at Risk International</a>; Carmen Kusinich, an FBI Victim Specialist who works with victims of trafficking in Western Michigan; and Jane White, the Director of the Michigan Human Trafficking Task Force (that includes over 90 member organizations,) responded to questions from the audience.  Addressing the adequacy of Michigan’s legislation for human trafficking, Jane White mentioned that the further their task force gets involved with these issues, they find things in the law they weren’t previously aware of, that can often help with prosecutions.  But White also went on to emphasize the need to care for survivors of trafficking, saying, “…what hasn’t happened is the support of the victim.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Outside the Abbey Pub in Chicago.)</p>
<p>The next day we journeyed eastward to Chicago where we had been able to make arrangements for a screening less than one week prior.  We didn’t know what type of event it would be; we just had contact with a church that meets at the Abbey Pub, in Chicago’s Irving Park neighborhood.  When we arrived, we were surprised to learn that even though it looks like a small venue, it has hosted a plethora of bands including The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, Wilco, and Mumford &amp; Sons.  Even though it was a smaller audience, we were thankful to have the chance to share the film with a lot of our friends who call Chicago home, as well as a few new acquaintances.  After the film, Isaac Gill and Megan Perry performed a few of their songs that are on the recently released <a href="http://sexandmoneystore.com/products/158370-listening-for-human-worth" target="_blank">Sex+Money: Listening For Human Worth</a> music compilation that is now available in our online store.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Showing the film at Iowa State University.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last Thursday our team rolled into Ames, Iowa for our screening at Iowa State University.  We were honored to have some human trafficking experts make the drive over from Omaha, Nebraska to serve on the panel after the film.  Panelists included US Attorney Stephen Patrick O’Meara; an FBI agent from the Omaha Division; Detective John Focht, from the Vice Department at the Council Bluffs PD; and Brittany, a survivor of domestic minor sex trafficking.  Since we had such experienced panelists, we were glad to have a broad window of time for audience questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.sexandmoneyfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9170_blur.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-269" title="IMG_9170_blur" src="http://blog.sexandmoneyfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9170_blur.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="840" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Morgan Perry moderating the panel at Iowa State University. Panelists L-R: US Attorney Stephen Patrick O’Meara; and FBI agent, Detective John Focht, and Brittany, a survivor of domestic minor sex trafficking.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Speaking from the standpoint of someone who, as a young teenager, ran away from an unstable living situation and was tricked into sex trafficking, Brittany was able to bring the reality of this issue one step closer to the audience.  As she talked about her life after rehabilitation and being placed with a stable foster home, she said, “I had a place to live and a loving family.  I didn’t want to give that up or go back to what I was doing.”  Her comments emphasized the reality that domestic minor sex trafficking is not a story of numbers and graphs; it’s the story of men and women who are looking for a place where they are valued and respected, even on the most basic level of humanity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Towards the end of the discussion, as Panelist O’Meara was directing the audience back to looking at the human element of sex trafficking, he said, “If you look at what is thrown at people today, it isn’t just sexual dehumanization.  There’s a tendency not to see the human element of the one who is victimized.”  O’Meara then proceeded to emphasize the role that individual communities can play in fighting these crimes, saying, “The real answer is cultural; government can never solve this…the solution is sitting out here in the seats.”  He concluded with the question, “How do we measure what it means to be human, and from that how do we determine what it means to be a victim?…When you have to get back to dealing with people, this all looks a lot different.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Praise Community Church in Mason City, Iowa.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On Friday the 16th, with the help of Praise Community Church, we showed the film at North Iowa Community College in Mason City, Iowa.  We were grateful that the local television news station promoted the screening, with narrator Sarah Jo Sampson making an appearance in their studio.  We enjoyed the opportunity to share the film with Praise Community, as well as many of Sarah Jo’s relatives who live in Iowa.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Metrobrook Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.)</p>
<p>On Sunday, we went into Milwaukee, Wisconsin for a screening at Metrobrook Church.  The church meets in a traditional style church building, which, before being purchased by Metrobrook a couple of years ago, was set aside for demolition.  As we shared the film in the redeemed physical building of Metrobrook Church, it was easy to draw parallels to the countless lives in our nation that, though abused and torn down, are in need of being brought to redemption.  Some might be formerly prostituted or abused, while others might be recovering from addictions to pornography, while others might be the johns and traffickers themselves.  As we continue to share the film in a diversity of audiences and settings, we are reminded of the hope we have that even from hurt and despair, neglected potential can be recovered, and new structures can be constructed.</p>
