WEBC2-KT3 (FAMILY)</short_description>
  <description>The WEBC2 malware family is designed to retrieve a Web page from a pre-determined C2 server. It expects the Web page to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt to interpret the data between the tags as commands.  The WEBC2-KT3 variant searches for commands in a specific comment tag.  Network traffic starting with *!Kt3+v| may indicate WEBC2-KT3 activity
