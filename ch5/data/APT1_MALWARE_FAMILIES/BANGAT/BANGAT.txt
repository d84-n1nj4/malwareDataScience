The BANGAT malware family shares a large amount of functionality with the AURIGA backdoor.  The malware family contains functionality for keylogging, creating and killing processes, performing filesystem and registry modifications, spawning interactive command shells, performing process injection, logging off the current user or shutting down the local machine.  In addition, the malware also implements a custom VNC like protocol which sends screenshots of the desktop to the C2 server and accepts keyboard and mouse input.  The malware communicates to its C2 servers using SSL, with self signed SSL certificates.  The malware family will create a copy of cmd.exe to perform its C2 activity, and replace the "Microsoft corp" strings in the cmd.exe binary with different values.  The malware family typically maintains persistence through installing itself as a service.
