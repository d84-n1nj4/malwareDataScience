COOKIEBAG (FAMILY)</short_description>
  <description>This family of malware is a backdoor capable of file upload and download as well as providing remote interactive shell access to the compromised machine.
Communication with the Command &amp; Control (C2) servers uses a combination of single-byte XOR and Base64 encoded data in the Cookie and Set-Cookie HTTP header fields. Communication with the C2 servers is over port 80. Some variants install a registry key as means of a persistence mechanism. The hardcoded strings cited include a string of a command in common with several other APT1 families.
