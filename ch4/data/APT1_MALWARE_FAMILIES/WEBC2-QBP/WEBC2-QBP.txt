WEBC2-QBP (FAMILY)</short_description>
  <description>The WEBC2 malware family is designed to retrieve a Web page from a pre-determined C2 server. It expects the Web page to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt to interpret the data between the tags as commands.  The WEBC2-QBP variant will search for two strings in a HTML comment. The first will be "2010QBP " followed by " 2010QBP//--".  Inside these tags will be a DES-encrypted string.
