GLOOXMAIL communicates with Google's Jabber/XMPP servers and authenticates with a hard-coded username and password.  The malware can accept commands over XMPP that includes file upload and download, provide a remote shell, sending process listings, and terminating specified processes.  The malware makes extensive use of the open source gloox library (http://camaya.net/gloox/, version 0.9.9.12) to communicate using the Jabber/XMPP protocol.  All communications with the Google XMPP server are encrypted.
