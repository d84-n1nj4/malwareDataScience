#### *Attack Detection and Attribution*

This is a book written by _Joshua Saxe_ and _Hillary Sanders_. This book was written to show how to apply machine learning, statistics, and data visualization as you build your own detection and intelligence systems. I'm familiar with the data science techniques referenced in this book. I'm not familiar with malware detection. I'm interested in learning more regarding the cyber security aspect of data science. I decided to create this repo to walk through this book and share my experience. For each chapter, I'll provide a walk through of the code provided in the book, as well as the overall concepts.
