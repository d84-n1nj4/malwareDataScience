#### *Chapter 1: Basic Static Malware Analysis*

Our first task presented to us in chapter one is parsing of a PE file. Just prior to this, the chapter gives some good insights into _Microsoft Windows Portable Executable Format_. Understanding this format is crucial to knowing the structure of modern Windows program files (i.e., .exe, .dll, and .sys). Wikipedia actually has a nice overview of [Portable Executable](_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable). In order to parse the PE file, we are going to utilize the python module [pefile](https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile_). Using _pefile_ we can access most of the information in the PE files headers, as well as all the sections' details and data. The PE file that we will be parsing is _ircbot.exe_. This executable file is supposed to live on a target computer, and the hacker utilizing the file would run commands through an irc (internet relay chat) server once the executable file gains control of the target computer. The first thing we will do while parsing the PE file is pull section data as shown below:
